He said that the EU is outpacing even US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly America. “MiCA’s licensing window opened on Jan. 1, 2025; in that very quarter, our EU volumes jumped 70% while the number of trades hardly moved, which tells me the new money was larger and more deliberate,” Vasilenko said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 5, 8 am UTC): This article has been updated to insert comments from the ECB and Nicholas Anthony. The European Central Bank (ECB) has approved a two-track plan to settle distributed ledger technology (DLT) transactions using central bank money, which could pave the way to modernizing Europe’s financial system. The first track, dubbed Pontes, will focus on a short-term solution by linking blockchain-based DLT platforms with TARGET Services, a suite of financial services developed and operated by the Eurosystem designed to facilitate the flow of payments and securities within the eurozone. A pilot for Pontes is expected to launch by the end of the third quarter of 2026, the ECB said Tuesday. This pilot will use insights from the ECB’s exploratory DLT trials in 2024, which involved over 50 experiments and 64 participants, to test a unified settlement system with central bank money. “The decision is in line with the Eurosystem’s commitment to supporting innovation without compromising on safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures,” the ECB wrote. Related: Europe gears up to regulate DeFi in 2026 as MiCA leaves sector in limbo Second track takes long-term approach The second track, called Appia, takes a longer-term approach, aiming to develop an “integrated ecosystem in Europe that also facilitates safe and efficient operations at the global level.” Appia will see the ECB continue to study DLT applications in wholesale central bank settlements while working closely with public and private partners. The Eurosystem will also set up market contact groups for both Pontes and Appia to maintain dialogue with industry stakeholders and gather feedback. A call for expressions of interest to join the Pontes group will be published soon. “It’s difficult to say whether this will prove to be an important step until the testing results are published. In the past, most central banks testing the use of distributed ledger technology have said it ultimately didn’t fit their goals,” Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said. The plan comes as central banks worldwide explore how blockchain can streamline settlements while maintaining control over money flows. In 2023, a Bank of England experiment, conducted through the BIS London innovation hub, successfully tested using DLT to run large-scale interbank transactions . It demonstrated a prototype that could speed up and lower the costs of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems by linking them with other financial infrastructures and ledgers. “With its dual-track strategy, the Eurosystem ensures that central bank money, the safest of all settlement assts, can continue to be used as settlement asset on the wholesale market and as anchor for the two-tier monetary system,” the ECB told Cointelegrpah, adding: “Furthermore, the initiative aims to promote strong, stable and integrated European payments and capital markets, will safeguard the strategic autonomy, as well as maintain and develop the international role of the euro.” Related: ECB flags risk of financial contagion from US crypto push DLT trials reveal demand for central bank money The ECB also published a report detailing the results of its recent DLT exploratory work.

The development is partially due to the fact that the worldwide stablecoin market leader Tether has so far declined to comply with the MiCA framework . This led to USDt ( USDT ) being delisted from Binance , as well as competitors such as Kraken and Coinbase , for users in the European Economic Area. Related: MiCA-compliant stablecoins dominate European market — Kaiko Stablecoins race for MiCA compliance Earlier this week, Paxos announced the launch of its MiCA-compliant Global Dollar (USDG) stablecoin in the EU . Mid-April reports revealed that the market cap of Circle’s MiCA-compliant stablecoin Euro Coin ( EURC ) was growing quickly . Circle’s stablecoins likely benefited from the implementation of MiCA, with Euro Coin and USDC ( USDC ) reaping the rewards of its regulatory-friendly approach. The company’s stablecoins are the top euro and US dollar-pegged stablecoins that comply with MiCA. Still, CoinMarketCap data shows that USDt remains the undisputed market leader, with a market cap of under $158 billion.

The development is partially due to the fact that the worldwide stablecoin market leader Tether has so far declined to comply with the MiCA framework . This led to USDt ( USDT ) being delisted from Binance , as well as competitors such as Kraken and Coinbase , for users in the European Economic Area.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now sees tokenization as an “innovation” to be encouraged in the marketplace, according to Chair Paul Atkins, who pointed to a clear regulatory shift since former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure ended. “Tokenization is an innovation,” Atkins said in a CNBC interview on Wednesday. “And we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace.” Atkins contrasted his approach to crypto regulation with his predecessors, saying the SEC had previously hindered innovation through vague laws and “regulation through enforcement.” “That day is over,” Atkins said, adding: “My whole goal is to make things transparent from the regulatory aspect and give people a firm foundation upon which to innovate and come out with new products.” Source: BTCTN Atkins was sworn in as SEC chair in April after being nominated by US President Donald Trump on inauguration day. He has been widely recognized for his openness toward cryptocurrency and digital finance, as well as his emphasis on developing a robust regulatory framework for the sector. Atkins, like others, has recognized the importance of supporting the growing tokenization economy. Tokenization has emerged as a key driver of crypto adoption, thanks in large part to a more pro-crypto regulatory environment in the United States, according to a recent Binance Research report shared with Cointelegraph. The World Economic Forum also views tokenization as a promising bridge between traditional financial systems and blockchain, with the potential to reshape global finance. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year , with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone.

The chair’s pro-crypto push, specifically, has been matched by tangible progress on the regulatory front. In April, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance on company disclosures related to digital assets, aiming to clarify which tokens fall under securities laws. The regulator also recently approved the first US crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Solana ( SOL ), allowing investors to hold the cryptocurrency and earn yield through staking. The approved fund, issued by REX Shares and Osprey, debuted on Wednesday . Large financial institutions are also responding to the pro-industry regulatory shift by prioritizing tokenization as a new business model.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now sees tokenization as an “innovation” to be encouraged in the marketplace, according to Chair Paul Atkins, who pointed to a clear regulatory shift since former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure ended. “Tokenization is an innovation,” Atkins said in a CNBC interview on Wednesday. “And we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace.” Atkins contrasted his approach to crypto regulation with his predecessors, saying the SEC had previously hindered innovation through vague laws and “regulation through enforcement.” “That day is over,” Atkins said, adding: “My whole goal is to make things transparent from the regulatory aspect and give people a firm foundation upon which to innovate and come out with new products.” Source: BTCTN Atkins was sworn in as SEC chair in April after being nominated by US President Donald Trump on inauguration day. He has been widely recognized for his openness toward cryptocurrency and digital finance, as well as his emphasis on developing a robust regulatory framework for the sector. Atkins, like others, has recognized the importance of supporting the growing tokenization economy. Tokenization has emerged as a key driver of crypto adoption, thanks in large part to a more pro-crypto regulatory environment in the United States, according to a recent Binance Research report shared with Cointelegraph. The World Economic Forum also views tokenization as a promising bridge between traditional financial systems and blockchain, with the potential to reshape global finance. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year , with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone.

The chair’s pro-crypto push, specifically, has been matched by tangible progress on the regulatory front. In April, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance on company disclosures related to digital assets, aiming to clarify which tokens fall under securities laws. The regulator also recently approved the first US crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Solana ( SOL ), allowing investors to hold the cryptocurrency and earn yield through staking. The approved fund, issued by REX Shares and Osprey, debuted on Wednesday . Large financial institutions are also responding to the pro-industry regulatory shift by prioritizing tokenization as a new business model. According to Bloomberg , JPMorgan Chase is exploring the tokenization of carbon credits through its Kinexys blockchain unit, in partnership with S&P Global Commodity Insights, the International Carbon Registry and EcoRegistry.

Listen 0:00 Markets News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is now earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund than its flagship S&P 500 fund, according to a recent report. “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Bitcoin has now captured Wall Street’s “undivided attention” With an expense ratio of 0.25% and around $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF (IBIT) has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, approximately $100,000 more than its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). The IVV, which launched in 2000, is over eight times larger than the IBIT, with approximately $624 billion in assets, but charges almost nine times less, at just 0.03%. Several crypto executives were quick to comment on the findings. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in an X post, “Bitcoin has Wall Street’s full, undivided attention now.” Strive Funds chief financial officer Ben Pham said Bitcoin will be “the death” of active management and passive indexation portfolios. Source: Rezo Crypto trader Cade O’Neill said it “says everything about where capital is headed. Institutions aren’t just curious anymore, they’re committed.” Meanwhile, McKay Research founder James McKay said the news was bullish and “Probably something.” Related: Bitcoin’s STH cost basis suggests $117K is the next stop for BTC price Since its January 2024 launch, BlackRock’s IBIT has recorded $52.4 billion in inflows, the highest of any US spot Bitcoin ETF, according to Farside data.

The uptick comes as Bitcoin’s price spiked 2.82% over the same period, which is now trading at $108,660. Meanwhile, the IVV closed the day at $623.42, up 0.44% over the day.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED This article has been updated on July 4 at 00.30 UTC to include comments from James Seyffart. The United States’ first Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) ended its debut trading day with $12 million in inflows — a positive sign for crypto staking-enabled ETFs. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF debuted on the Cboe BZX Exchange on Wednesday, recording $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in inflows, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The fund , trading under SSK, gives investors direct exposure to spot Solana ( SOL ) along with staking yields, making it the first crypto staking ETF to be approved in America. It was a “healthy start to trading,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who observed that it had seen $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes. Balchunas also commented on the impressive first-day volumes, stating that it “blows away” the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs but was much lower than the spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) funds when they launched. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $4.6 billion worth of shares traded on their first day in January 2024. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs is a defining moment for digital assets and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” said Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, whose firm is the staking and custodian partner for the REX-Osprey ETF. “I don't think this really tells us all that much,” Seyffart told Cointelegraph. “What we can see is that there will definitely be demand for these products. We are also in a shortened week in the US for the 4th of July, so demand and trading might even be more muted than it otherwise would be.” SSK first day volume. Source: Eric Balchunas Fund faced regulatory hurdles The REX-Osprey fund faced regulatory hurdles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which objected to it in late May after clearing an initial registration. The issue was whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under securities laws, but the firm managed to get around this by investing at least 40% of its assets in other ETPs, mostly domiciled outside the US. More eyes on spot Solana ETF, altcoin ETF summer Unlike spot Solana ETFs that still require approval from the SEC, REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act 1940, which sidesteps the standard 19b-4 filing process. In May, NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci described it as  “regulatory end-around.” However, some have debated whether the fund should be considered a traditional spot Solana ETF. Meanwhile, the ETF’s recent performance could shed light on institutional demand for a spot Solana ETF, which may launch this year. Seyffart and Balchunas recently pegged a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs would be approved by the end of the year. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in the second half of 2025,” Seyffart said earlier this week, predicting that spot XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ( LTC ) products would be greenlit by the SEC before the end of the year. Related: Analysts raise chance of SOL, XRP and LTC ETF approval to 95% On Tuesday, the regulator approved a Grayscale application to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund comprises a basket of the top five digital assets by market capitalization. SOL prices see minor reaction There was no major reaction in Solana prices, which have gained 3.6% over the past 24 hours, lower than most of the other high-cap altcoins. The asset was trading around $153 at the time of writing and was up around 5% over the past week, but still down 48% from its January peak. However, Solana CME futures saw “record demand, signaling rising institutional interest” as open interest hit $167 million following the ETF launch, reported SolanaFloor.
