Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 5, 8 am UTC): This article has been updated to insert comments from the ECB and Nicholas Anthony. The European Central Bank (ECB) has approved a two-track plan to settle distributed ledger technology (DLT) transactions using central bank money, which could pave the way to modernizing Europe’s financial system. The first track, dubbed Pontes, will focus on a short-term solution by linking blockchain-based DLT platforms with TARGET Services, a suite of financial services developed and operated by the Eurosystem designed to facilitate the flow of payments and securities within the eurozone. A pilot for Pontes is expected to launch by the end of the third quarter of 2026, the ECB said Tuesday. This pilot will use insights from the ECB’s exploratory DLT trials in 2024, which involved over 50 experiments and 64 participants, to test a unified settlement system with central bank money. “The decision is in line with the Eurosystem’s commitment to supporting innovation without compromising on safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures,” the ECB wrote. Related: Europe gears up to regulate DeFi in 2026 as MiCA leaves sector in limbo Second track takes long-term approach The second track, called Appia, takes a longer-term approach, aiming to develop an “integrated ecosystem in Europe that also facilitates safe and efficient operations at the global level.” Appia will see the ECB continue to study DLT applications in wholesale central bank settlements while working closely with public and private partners. The Eurosystem will also set up market contact groups for both Pontes and Appia to maintain dialogue with industry stakeholders and gather feedback. A call for expressions of interest to join the Pontes group will be published soon. “It’s difficult to say whether this will prove to be an important step until the testing results are published. In the past, most central banks testing the use of distributed ledger technology have said it ultimately didn’t fit their goals,” Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said. The plan comes as central banks worldwide explore how blockchain can streamline settlements while maintaining control over money flows. In 2023, a Bank of England experiment, conducted through the BIS London innovation hub, successfully tested using DLT to run large-scale interbank transactions . It demonstrated a prototype that could speed up and lower the costs of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems by linking them with other financial infrastructures and ledgers. “With its dual-track strategy, the Eurosystem ensures that central bank money, the safest of all settlement assts, can continue to be used as settlement asset on the wholesale market and as anchor for the two-tier monetary system,” the ECB told Cointelegrpah, adding: “Furthermore, the initiative aims to promote strong, stable and integrated European payments and capital markets, will safeguard the strategic autonomy, as well as maintain and develop the international role of the euro.” Related: ECB flags risk of financial contagion from US crypto push DLT trials reveal demand for central bank money The ECB also published a report detailing the results of its recent DLT exploratory work.

However, it pointed out the need for standardization, harmonized legal frameworks, and “an interoperability link with TARGET Services as soon as feasible.” Magazine: Pakistan will deploy Bitcoin reserve in DeFi for yield, says Bilal Bin Saqib # Blockchain # Central Bank # Europe # Investments # Adoption # ECB # Euro # European Union # Blockchain Storage # DLT Add reaction","summary":"Amin Haqshanas Jul 02, 2025 ECB to pilot blockchain-based euro settlement system by 2026 The European Central Bank will launch a blockchain settlement pilot by late 2026 under its new Pontes initiative, aiming to connect DLT platforms with the eurozone’s core payment systems.","publish_time":"2025-07-02 11:07:35+00:00","source":"CoinTelegraph","index_id":997},"_market_context":"{\"date\": \"2025-07-02\", \"layer1\": {\"dxy\": 119.7289, \"dxy_trend_30d\": \"Downtrend\", \"liquidity_change_30d_b\": -7.42, \"liquidity_billions\": 6062.77}, \"layer2\": {\"etf_date\": \"2025-07-02\", \"_fill\": \"historical\"}, \"layer3\": {\"_fill\": \"historical\"}, \"layer4\": {\"fear_greed_index\": 63, \"_fill\": \"historical\"}}","_rag_memories":["It’s the start of a new quarter, and a new month\n\nIt’s also Jubilant July\n\nI gotta say.

As Cointelegraph reported at the time , Silicon Valley Bank was the first FDIC-insured bank to fail that year. Its collapse left a massive gap in the market, as the bank had served about half of all venture capital–backed tech and life sciences companies in the United States.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto firm Ripple Labs is applying for a banking license in the US, following a similar move by stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group as crypto firms look to be regulated to deepen ties with traditional finance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed on X on Wednesday that the company is applying for a license with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), following an earlier report by The Wall Street Journal. “True to our long-standing compliance roots, Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC,” he wrote. Garlinghouse said if the license is approved, it would be a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market” as the firm would be under federal and state oversight — with the New York Department of Financial Services already regulating its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. Source: Brad Garlinghouse Ripple follows Circle on wanting bank charter Ripple’s decision to get a banking license came just two days after Circle, which issues the second-largest stablecoin USDC ( USDC ), applied to the OCC to create a national trust bank that would oversee its stablecoin reserves. The move by both firms comes as the US Senate passed a stablecoin regulating bill called the GENIUS Act , which lays out standards for offering the US dollar-pegged tokens, including that the OCC will oversee larger stablecoin issuers. Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said the company was taking “proactive steps” to “align with emerging US regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins.” Anchorage Digital is the only crypto firm that holds a national bank charter. Ripple bids for Fed master account Ripple’s Garlinghouse added that the company also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve, which would give it access to the US central banking system. “This access would allow us to hold $RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed and provide an additional layer of security to future proof trust in RLUSD,” Garlinghouse said. Related: Bitcoin Vs. Stablecoins showdown looms as GENIUS Act nears “Congress is working towards clear rules and regulations, and banks (in a far cry from the years of Operation Chokepoint 2.0) are leaning in,” he added, mentioning the conspiracy that the Biden administration sought to cut off crypto from the financial system. Ripple applied for the account through Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm it acquired in February 2024. XRP gains over 3% on Ripple’s bank charter application XRP ( XRP ), the token of the XRP Ledger blockchain that Ripple Labs uses for its products, has risen 3.2% over the past day to trade at $2.24, according to CoinGecko. The token began to climb late on Wednesday before hitting a 24-hour peak of $2.27 around the time of Garlinghouse’s post before slightly cooling from its rally.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED This article has been updated on July 4 at 00.30 UTC to include comments from James Seyffart. The United States’ first Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) ended its debut trading day with $12 million in inflows — a positive sign for crypto staking-enabled ETFs. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF debuted on the Cboe BZX Exchange on Wednesday, recording $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in inflows, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The fund , trading under SSK, gives investors direct exposure to spot Solana ( SOL ) along with staking yields, making it the first crypto staking ETF to be approved in America. It was a “healthy start to trading,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who observed that it had seen $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes. Balchunas also commented on the impressive first-day volumes, stating that it “blows away” the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs but was much lower than the spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) funds when they launched. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $4.6 billion worth of shares traded on their first day in January 2024. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs is a defining moment for digital assets and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” said Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, whose firm is the staking and custodian partner for the REX-Osprey ETF. “I don't think this really tells us all that much,” Seyffart told Cointelegraph. “What we can see is that there will definitely be demand for these products. We are also in a shortened week in the US for the 4th of July, so demand and trading might even be more muted than it otherwise would be.” SSK first day volume. Source: Eric Balchunas Fund faced regulatory hurdles The REX-Osprey fund faced regulatory hurdles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which objected to it in late May after clearing an initial registration. The issue was whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under securities laws, but the firm managed to get around this by investing at least 40% of its assets in other ETPs, mostly domiciled outside the US. More eyes on spot Solana ETF, altcoin ETF summer Unlike spot Solana ETFs that still require approval from the SEC, REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act 1940, which sidesteps the standard 19b-4 filing process. In May, NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci described it as  “regulatory end-around.” However, some have debated whether the fund should be considered a traditional spot Solana ETF. Meanwhile, the ETF’s recent performance could shed light on institutional demand for a spot Solana ETF, which may launch this year. Seyffart and Balchunas recently pegged a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs would be approved by the end of the year. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in the second half of 2025,” Seyffart said earlier this week, predicting that spot XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ( LTC ) products would be greenlit by the SEC before the end of the year. Related: Analysts raise chance of SOL, XRP and LTC ETF approval to 95% On Tuesday, the regulator approved a Grayscale application to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund comprises a basket of the top five digital assets by market capitalization. SOL prices see minor reaction There was no major reaction in Solana prices, which have gained 3.6% over the past 24 hours, lower than most of the other high-cap altcoins. The asset was trading around $153 at the time of writing and was up around 5% over the past week, but still down 48% from its January peak. However, Solana CME futures saw “record demand, signaling rising institutional interest” as open interest hit $167 million following the ETF launch, reported SolanaFloor.
