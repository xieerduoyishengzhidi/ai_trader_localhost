Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Commission’s proposal to expand the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is raising concerns about the centralization of the bloc’s licensing regime, despite signaling deeper institutional ambitions for its capital markets structure. On Thursday, the Commission published a package proposing to “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties to ESMA , Cointelegraph reported. Concerningly, the ESMA’s jurisdiction would extend to both the supervision and licensing of all European crypto and financial technology (fintech) firms, potentially leading to slower licensing regimes and hindering startup development, according to Faustine Fleuret, head of public affairs at decentralized lending protocol Morpho. “I am even more concerned that the proposal makes ESMA responsible for both the authorisation and the supervision of CASPs, not only the supervision,” she told Cointelegraph. The proposal still requires approval from the European Parliament and the Council, which are currently under negotiation. If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission , a concept first proposed by European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde in 2023.

""Without adequate resources, this mandate may become unmanageable, leading to delays or overly cautious assessments that could disproportionately affect smaller or innovative firms."" “Ultimately, the effectiveness of this reform will depend less on its legal form and more on its institutional execution,” including ESMA’s operational capacity, independence and cooperation “channels” with member states, she said.

Improving liquidity conditions and rising odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut may catalyze a recovery in the crypto market during December, according to Coinbase Institutional. “We think crypto could be poised for a December recovery as liquidity improves, Fed cut odds jump to 92% (as of Dec 4), and macro tailwinds build,” wrote Coinbase in a Friday research report. In October, Coinbase predicted “weakness” in the crypto market ahead of a “December reversal,” based on its custom global M2 money supply index, which measures the total outstanding fiat currency supply.

Bitcoin's ( BTC ) prospects for the first quarter of 2026 may hinge more on the remarks of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau educational platform. He told Cointelegraph: ""If the Fed cuts rates on December 10th, along with ending QT, there's little standing in the way of a Santa rally for Bitcoin - bar any major geopolitical bombshell.” “However, investors will scrutinise Jerome Powell’s every word during the press conference to get a glimpse into 2026 monetary policy, and any hawkishness could put a lid on the rally,” he said.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED On Thursday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) products will begin trading for the first time on its registered futures exchanges. Here are three reasons why this is a big deal for the top two cryptocurrencies heading into 2026. Key takeaways : CFTC oversight gives BTC and ETH gold-like legitimacy, opening the door to larger institutional flows. Regulated US trading boosts liquidity, cuts volatility, and shifts crypto activity back onshore. Bitcoin and Ethereum can scale like gold One of the strongest historical parallels for the CFTC decision came from the gold market . When gold was formally opened to trading on regulated US futures exchanges in the 1970s, the shift transformed it from a fragmented, over-the-counter commodity into a globally recognized investment asset. Liquidity concentrated on COMEX, institutions entered for the first time, and transparent price discovery created a foundation for long-term capital flows. Since its COMEX debut, spot gold prices gained 4,000%, illustrating how regulatory clarity can reshape an asset’s market trajectory. XAU/USD yearly performance chart. Source: TradingView The CFTC placed Bitcoin and Ethereum under a similar commodity framework with its latest announcement, thus removing the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) issuer-focused requirements. It also filled a long-standing gap: US traders could access crypto on platforms like Coinbase and Kraken but lacked regulated spot leverage, deep liquidity tools, or exchange-level protections. That absence forced liquidity offshore, with recent 2025 data showing Binance capturing roughly 41.1% of global spot activity, far ahead of US-based venues. With regulated spot markets now approved domestically, Bitcoin and Ethereum gain the same structural foundation that helped gold evolve from a niche hedge into a mature, globally traded asset class. Source: X CFTC improves institutional exposure for BTC, ETH Pension funds, banks, and hedge funds that previously sat on the sidelines can now treat Bitcoin and Ethereum like other CFTC-recognized commodities, with standardized rules, surveillance, and custody requirements.

What pension funds are starting to discover 86% of institutional investors already have or plan to gain crypto exposure, and most increased their allocations in 2024 as US regulation improved, according to a joint survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon in January. Source: X A majority also preferred accessing crypto through regulated investment rails, such as commodity exchanges or ETFs, rather than offshore venues. Following the CFTC decision, institutions can now access Bitcoin and Ethereum through regulated exchanges, audited custody, and supervised pricing, setting the stage for stronger, more durable mainstream adoption. Bitcoin, Ether may see better liquidity growth Historical evidence suggested that commodities expanded rapidly after debuting on regulated trading venues. A case in point is the launch of WTI oil futures in 1983, whose trading exploded from just 3,000 contracts in the first month to over 100,000 per month within a year, and then to over 2 million contracts per month by the late 1980s. WTI two-week chart. Source: TradingView Today, WTI often exceeds a million contracts in daily volume, a testament to how regulation can foster colossal market growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum can witness a similar liquidity boost, with CFTC-approved spot trading likely to attract many more US traders and market makers, thus increasing order book depth and reducing spreads. Deep liquidity and robust volume on US soil can also reduce volatility over time , as large buy or sell orders are more easily absorbed.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Clear Street, a New York brokerage that has become one of the most active underwriters in the crypto-treasury boom, is preparing to go public with an expected valuation of $10 billion to $12 billion. The IPO could come as early as next month, with Goldman Sachs lined up to lead the offering, the Financial Times reported , citing people familiar with the matter. One source reportedly told the FT that the deal is unlikely to price before January. Founded in 2018, Clear Street rose to prominence as dozens of public companies began adopting the “crypto treasury” playbook, raising capital through equity or debt markets and using the proceeds to buy large quantities of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The strategy was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has accumulated 650,000 BTC through multiple stock and convertible offerings underwritten in part by Clear Street. The firm also served as an underwriter for Trump Media and Technology Group, which has signaled plans to raise billions to establish a Bitcoin treasury operation of its own. According to its website, Clear Street has underwritten about $91 billion in combined equity, debt and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions so far this year, including deals for well-known crypto advocates Anthony Pompliano and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

Many smaller crypto treasury firms now trade at discounts to the value of the tokens they hold, cutting off their ability to issue new stock to buy more BTC, the same mechanism that powered the model during the bull run. In a recent report, Galaxy Research said that Bitcoin treasury companies are entering a “Darwinian phase” as the core mechanics of their once-booming business model break down. “For treasury companies whose equities had been serving as leveraged crypto trades, the shift has been intense,” Galaxy said, adding that the “same financial engineering that amplified upside has magnified downside.” Related: Revolut hits $75B valuation following share sale, global push Crypto companies rush to go public According to the FT, roughly 316 companies have been listed in the US this year, raising around $63 billion, the highest total since 2021.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin treasury companies are entering a “Darwinian phase” as the core mechanics of their once-booming business model break down, according to a new analysis from Galaxy Research. The report said that the digital asset treasury (DAT) trade has reached its natural limit as equity prices fell below Bitcoin ( BTC ) net asset value (NAV), causing the issuance-driven growth loop to reverse and turning leverage into a liability. That breaking point arrived as Bitcoin dropped from its October peak near $126,000 to lows around $80,000, triggering a sharp contraction in risk appetite and draining liquidity across the market. The October 10 deleveraging event accelerated the shift, wiping out open interest across futures markets and weakening spot depth. “For treasury companies whose equities had been serving as leveraged crypto trades, the shift has been intense,” Galaxy said, adding that the “same financial engineering that amplified upside has magnified downside.” Related: Cantor slashes Strategy target by 60%, tells clients forced-sale fears are overblown DAT stocks flip to discounts DAT stocks that traded at rich premiums to NAV over the summer are now mostly at discounts, even as Bitcoin itself is down only around 30% from highs. Companies such as Metaplanet and Nakamoto, which previously showed hundreds of millions in unrealized gains, are now deep in the red as average BTC purchase prices sit above $107,000. Galaxy noted that the leverage embedded in these firms is exposing them to extreme downside, with one firm, NAKA, plunging more than 98% from its peak. “This price action resembles the kind of wipeouts seen in memecoin markets,” the firm wrote. Metaplanet’s unrealized PnL reaches $530 million. Source: Galaxy With issuance no longer available, Galaxy outlined three possible paths from here. The base case is a prolonged period of compressed premiums, during which BTC-per-share growth stagnates and DAT equities offer more downside than Bitcoin itself. A second outcome is consolidation, when firms that issued heavily at high premiums, bought BTC near the top, or loaded up on debt, face solvency pressure and may be acquired or restructured. A third scenario leaves room for recovery if Bitcoin eventually reaches new all-time highs, but only for companies that preserved liquidity and avoided over-issuing during the boom.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: The Federal Reserve’s move away from quantitative tightening and rate cuts creates liquidity, making fixed-income assets less attractive. Surging tech credit risks, as evidenced by high Oracle debt protection costs, prompt investors to seek alternative, scarcer assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell 4% on Friday to a low of $88,140, extending its decline to 19% since November. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is now less than 1% from its all-time high. This sharp divergence may soon close with a strong upside move for Bitcoin, fueled by a major shift in central bank policy and growing credit stress. This perfect storm has the potential to propel Bitcoin to the psychologically critical $100,000 barrier before the year concludes. Fixed income’s fading appeal and tech credit scare could fuel Bitcoin rally The most critical factor is the Federal Reserve’s pivot from quantitative tightening , a process of draining liquidity from the financial system by allowing the maturity of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities without reinvesting the proceeds. The Fed officially halted this program on Dec. 1. Total assets of the Federal Reserve, USD.

US Money Market fund assets, USD trillion. Source: Bloomberg Lower interest rates and increasing systemic liquidity fundamentally erode the demand for fixed-income assets. As the Fed cuts rates, the returns on new bond issuances also decline, making them less attractive to institutional funds. According to Bloomberg, there is now a record-high $8 trillion in US money-market funds. Credit Default Swaps for Oracle’s debt. Source: Bloomberg The potential capital rotation is further incentivized by structural risks emerging in the equity markets, especially in the tech sector. The cost of protecting Oracle’s (ORCL) debt against default using Credit Default Swaps has surged to its highest level since 2009. Oracle had $105 billion of debt, including leases, as of the end of August. Related: US investors consider crypto less as risk-taking drops–FINRA study Oracle is counting on hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues from OpenAI, according to Bloomberg. The company is the largest debt issuer outside of the banking industry in the Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index. “Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about how much more supply may be on the horizon,” according to a Citigroup credit strategy report. Bank of America says steady Fed rates increase economic slowdown odds Investors fear this high-stakes push, which includes US President Donald Trump’s Genesis Mission, a national initiative aimed at doubling US scientific productivity through the use of AI and nuclear energy. The surge in demand for debt protection signals extreme market unease regarding the immense debt-fueled spending, which may not yield adequate returns. Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argued that if the Fed sends a message of steady interest rates, the odds of a wider economic slowdown significantly increase. This uncertainty, combined with a desire for growth less dependent on stimulus, reinforces the appeal of Bitcoin's scarcity as institutional capital looks to de-risk its traditional tech exposures. The Fed’s official end to its liquidity drain program and the market’s aggressive pricing of interest rate cuts provide a monumental tailwind. With tech credit risks surging due to massive AI-related debt, capital is structurally primed to rotate into scarce assets. This convergence establishes a clear path for BTC to breach the $100,000 milestone over the next couple of months.

In 2025, that long-standing roadmap is beginning to look outdated — and analysts are seeking a new framework to understand where Bitcoin ( BTC ) is headed next. Some argue that institutional capital is reshaping the market. Others highlight the weakening impact of the halving, the rise of AI as a competing investment frontier, or global liquidity trends that no longer line up with old patterns. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be moving like it used to. In this exclusive Cointelegraph interview, Jeff Park, partner and chief investment officer at ProCap BTC, challenges the assumptions behind the four-year cycle, claiming that Bitcoin may now be transitioning into a much shorter, more dynamic two-year cycle. Park argues that Bitcoin’s market structure has undergone a fundamental shift as institutional flows operate under different incentives than those of retail investors. At the core of Park’s argument is a provocative idea: Shorter cycles could dramatically reshape how investors think about timing, volatility and Bitcoin’s potential path through 2026. Park also touches on why some players prefer short-term weakness, how liquidity patterns intersect with the new cycle and what this shift could mean for the next major move.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The lower house of Poland’s parliament failed to secure the required three-fifths majority to override President Karol Nawrocki’s veto of the Crypto-Asset Market Act, pushing the country further away from regulating its digital-asset sector at a moment when lawmakers argue that oversight is increasingly urgent. As Bloomberg reported Friday, the legislation — advanced by Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s government — was intended to align Poland with the European Union’s MiCA framework for crypto markets. The bill was introduced in June but did not survive the president’s veto. Nawrocki blocked the measure last week, arguing it would “threaten the freedoms of Poles, their property, and the stability of the state,” as Cointelegraph previously reported . With the president’s veto upheld, the bill will not move forward, forcing the government to restart its crypto lawmaking process. Source: Kancelaria Prezydenta RP The proposal has sharply divided lawmakers and the crypto industry. Supporters framed the bill as a national security priority, saying that comprehensive rules are necessary to curb fraud and prevent potential misuse of crypto assets by foreign actors, including Russia, according to Bloomberg. However, several crypto-industry groups opposed the legislation, warning that its requirements were overly burdensome and could drive startups out of the country. Critics pointed to stringent licensing rules , high compliance costs and criminal-liability provisions for service-provider executives, arguing that the bill risked stifling innovation and creating an uncompetitive business environment.

The fine follows a two-year investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which reportedly found that X was not doing enough to tackle illegal and harmful material. Regulators also said that the blue check marks on Elon Musk’s platform were deceiving. They did not follow industry decisions and negatively impacted users’ ability to make informed decisions about the authenticity of an account. The fine is part of a wider crackdown on Big Tech companies, particularly social media. TikTok reported it had avoided a fine by making concessions.

EU banks launch euro-stablecoin firm as EU considers ESMA crypto oversight A group of 10 European banks, including institutional heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, is planning to launch a stablecoin backed by the euro by the second half of 2026. BNP Paribas partnered with Danish Danske Bank, the Netherlands’ ING, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International and others to create and incorporate the project as Qivalis. The company will be based in Amsterdam. Qivalis CEO Jan-Oliver Sell said that stablecoins provide both convenience and monetary autonomy “in the digital age.” He said it will give “new opportunities for European companies and consumers to interact with on-chain payments and digital asset markets in their own currency.” The new project was announced days before the European Commission proposed expanding the powers of the EU’s key financial regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The proposal , released Thursday, would transfer supervision “over significant market infrastructures such as certain trading venues, Central Counterparties (CCPs), CSDs, and all Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs)” to the ESMA. The move is part of a broader effort to streamline European market regulation. Three countries — France, Italy and Austria — have requested that the ESMA take over crypto regulations. This followed concerns that there was uneven enforcement of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) standards across member states. Related: What is Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)?

South Africa flags crypto risks; new rules in the works The South African Reserve Bank, the country’s central bank, issued a warning on Nov. 25 about the perceived risks associated with stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. These include a lack of comprehensive regulations. The bank was concerned that the global and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies would make them ideal for skirting financial regulations. South Africa is second on the continent for value received in crypto. Source: Chainalysis Herco Steyn, the bank’s lead macroprudential specialist, reportedly said the risk stemmed from “the lack of a complementary and full regulatory framework, which is not possible at the moment.” In 2023, he wrote , “Regulatory influence over stablecoin issuers – whether domiciled domestically or abroad – may result in spillovers from the crypto asset ecosystem to the traditional financial system, particularly if South African regulatory authorities are unable to impose prudential requirements on stablecoin issuers.” To address this, the reserve bank is reportedly working on new rules with the National Treasury to monitor cross-border crypto transactions and change exchange control laws so they fall under regulatory scrutiny. IMF warns stablecoins could upend fragile financial systems On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a report on stablecoins outlining a number of risks, including: Volatility in value and runs Disintermediation of banks Interconnection with the financial system Currency substitution. It said that the “use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins, especially in cross-border contexts, could lead to currency substitution and potentially undermine monetary sovereignty, particularly in the presence of unhosted wallets.” The IMF also noted that many major stablecoin issuers don’t provide or offer any redemption rights for holders. “Uncertainty of treatment in case of insolvency of stablecoin issuer may also accelerate runs,” it said. Runs would also create first-mover advantages when there is a crisis of confidence, which could result in investors selling their holdings at a significant discount. The IMF did acknowledge possible benefits of stablecoins, including faster transactions compared to bank transfers, particularly in the context of cross-border transactions and remittances. They can also facilitate digital payment in remote areas and reduce counterparty risk when integrated with smart contracts.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Strategy (MSTR) won’t be forced to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat if its share price drops, and those who say otherwise are “just flat wrong,” says Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. “There is nothing about MSTR’s price dropping below NAV [net asset value] that will force it to sell,” Hougan argued in a note on Tuesday, pointing to chairman Michael Saylor’s steadfast conviction in Bitcoin ( BTC ). “It would indeed be very bad for the Bitcoin market if MSTR had to sell its $60 billion of Bitcoin in one go — that’s akin to two years of Bitcoin ETF inflows,” Hougan said. “But with no debt due until 2027 and enough cash to cover interest payments for the foreseeable future, I just don’t see it happening.” Fears that Strategy could sell its massive Bitcoin haul flared after the company’s CEO, Phong Le, said last week that it could offload some of its stash as a “last resort” if Strategy’s market value slipped below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Source: Matt Hougan If that happened, and Strategy’s financing options dried up, Le said it would be justifiable to offload some Bitcoin to protect the firm’s “Bitcoin yield per share.” Strategy is also facing a lengthy crypto market slump , along with a potential delisting from the MSCI stock market index. Strategy can weather the storm, Hougan says Hougan said that Strategy’s situation is not dire enough to start selling Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency trading around $92,000 is “24% above the average price at which Strategy acquired its stash ($74,436).” He added the company has a lot of leeway even if its stock drops below its NAV, as Strategy’s books show no near-term pressure that would force it to sell Bitcoin. “MSTR has two relevant obligations on its debt: It needs to pay about $800 million a year in interest and it needs to convert or roll over specific debt instruments as they come due,” he said. “The interest payments are not a near-term concern. The company has $1.4 billion in cash, meaning it can make its dividend payments easily for a year and a half,” he added. Related: Can the biggest Bitcoin whales really decide when the market turns green or red? Over the past 30 days, MSTR has declined 24.69%, ending trading on Friday at $186.01. Part of that downward pressure on the price may be a result of the announcement in October from Morgan Stanley Capital International, which stated that it may exclude from its indices digital asset treasury companies that have balance sheets with more than 50% crypto assets. Such a move would force index-tracking funds to sell, putting even more pressure on MSTR. Hougan doesn’t believe that will ultimately have a significant impact on sentiment toward Strategy or its share price, arguing that historically, such occurrences have been less impactful than expected. “My experience from watching index additions and deletions over the years is that the effect is typically smaller than you think and priced in well ahead of time,” he said. “When MSTR was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index last December, funds tracking the index had to buy $2.1 billion of the stock.

On Thursday, the Sui Foundation announced that 21Shares has launched its 2x leveraged SUI ( SUI ) ETF, trading under the ticker TXXS on the Nasdaq. The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily return of SUI, giving investors a way to gain leveraged exposure without directly holding the cryptocurrency. In practical terms, if SUI rises 10% in a single day, the ETF aims to rise by about 20%. Losses are similarly magnified on the downside. Rather than holding SUI tokens , the fund utilizes derivatives, including swaps and other financial contracts, to track the price movements of the token.

In October, the regulator said it was “unclear” whether the proposed three-times and five-times leveraged ETFs would meet regulatory standards.

Related: Atkins says SEC has ‘enough authority’ to drive crypto rules forward in 2026 The ongoing debate over crypto leverage The debate over curbing excessive leverage is particularly relevant in the cryptocurrency market, where heavy use of borrowed money continues to amplify price swings and, at times, trigger sharp losses for traders. On Oct. 10, the crypto market saw its largest leverage-driven sell-off on record , with roughly $19 billion worth of positions liquidated as prices fell rapidly and forced highly leveraged traders out of their positions. The fallout extended beyond leveraged traders to spot investors as well, who saw the value of their holdings decline in the weeks that followed. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for example, fell from a record high near $126,000 in October to below $80,000 in November. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Leverage plays a significantly larger role in crypto markets compared to traditional markets, largely due to the widespread use of derivatives exchanges and perpetual futures contracts. Platforms such as Binance and Bybit allow traders to take highly leveraged positions — often 10x, 50x or more — on so-called perpetual futures, which are contracts that track an asset’s price without an expiration date.

In the “Understanding Stablecoins” report released on Thursday, the IMF analyzed the various approaches regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union, had taken in establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Although the report noted that emerging regulations could mitigate risks to macrofinancial stability, the landscape was “fragmented,” both in policymakers’ approaches and how stablecoins are issued. “The proliferation of new stablecoins across different blockchains and exchanges raises concerns about inefficiencies due to potential lack of interoperability,” said the IMF. “Moreover, this can introduce differences and roadblocks among countries, due to different regulatory treatment and transaction hurdles.” The IMF added: “Although regulation of stablecoins helps authorities address [certain] risks, strong macro-policies and robust institutions [...] should be the first line of defense [...] International coordination remains key to solving these issues.” Source: IMF The report said that two of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Tether’s USDT ( USDt ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) were “backed mostly” by short-term US Treasurys, reverse repo collateralized with US Treasurys, and bank deposits.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Market maker Citadel Securities has recommended that the Securities and Exchange Commission tighten regulations on decentralized finance when it comes to tokenized stocks, causing backlash from crypto users. Citadel Securities told the SEC in a letter on Tuesday that DeFi developers, smart-contract coders, and self-custody wallet providers should not be given “broad exemptive relief” for offering trading of tokenized US equities. It argued that DeFi trading platforms likely fall under the definitions of an “exchange” or “broker-dealer” and should be regulated under securities laws if offering tokenized stocks. “Granting broad exemptive relief to facilitate the trading of a tokenized share via DeFi protocols would create two separate regulatory regimes for the trading of the same security,” it argued. “This outcome would be the exact opposite of the “technology-neutral” approach taken by the Exchange Act.” Citadel’s letter, made in response to the SEC looking for feedback on how it should approach regulating tokenized stocks , has drawn considerable backlash from the crypto community and organizations advocating for innovation in the blockchain space. Crypto users, Blockchain Association hits out “Whoever thought Citadel would be against innovation that removes predatory, rent-seeking intermediaries from the financial system?” asked lawyer and Blockchain Association board member Jake Chervinsky on Thursday. “Oh, right, literally every single person in crypto,” he added.

He added: “If you bought [Bitcoin] for a trade, it’s a very volatile asset. You’re going to have to be really good at market timing, which most people aren’t.” Fink’s comments stand in stark contrast to those he made in October 2017, before Bitcoin’s well-known bull run that drove the price of the cryptocurrency to then all-time highs.

Lord Speaker John McFall told the House of Lords on Tuesday that the Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill has received royal assent, meaning King Charles has formally approved it and it has now become law. Freddie New, policy chief at advocacy group Bitcoin Policy UK, said on X that the bill “becoming law is a massive step forward for Bitcoin in the United Kingdom and for everyone who holds and uses it here.” Source: Freddie New Common law in the UK, based on judges’ decisions, has established that digital assets are property , but the bill sought to codify a recommendation made by the Law Commission of England and Wales in 2024 that crypto be categorized as a new form of personal property for clarity. “UK courts have already treated digital assets as property, but that was all through case-by-case judgments,” said the advocacy group CryptoUK. “Parliament has now written this principle into law.” “This gives digital assets a much clearer legal footing — especially for things like proving ownership, recovering stolen assets, and handling them in insolvency or estate cases,” it added. Digital “things” now considered personal property CryptoUK said that the bill confirms “that digital or electronic ‘things’ can be objects of personal property rights.” UK law categorizes personal property in two ways: a “thing in possession,” which is tangible property such as a car, and and a “thing in action,” intangible property, like the right to enforce a contract. The bill clarifies that “a thing that is digital or electronic in nature” isn’t outside the realm of personal property rights just because it is neither a “thing in possession” nor a “thing in action.” The Law Commission argued in its report in 2024 that digital assets can possess both qualities, and said that their unclear fit into property rights laws could hamstring dispute resolutions in court. Related: Group of EU banks pushes for a euro-pegged stablecoin by 2027 Change gives “greater clarity” to crypto users CryptoUK said on X that the law gives “greater clarity and protection for consumers and investors” and gives crypto holders “the same confidence and certainty they expect with other forms of property.” “Digital assets can be clearly owned, recovered in cases of theft or fraud, and included within insolvency and estate processes,” it added. The group added that the UK now has a “clear legal basis for ownership and transfer” of crypto and the country would now be “better positioned to support the growth of new financial products, tokenised real-world assets, and more secure digital markets.” The country’s finance authority reported late last year that roughly 12% of UK adults own cryptocurrency, up from 10% in its previous findings. The UK also revealed plans for a crypto regulatory regime in April that would bring crypto businesses under similar rules to other finance companies, aiming to make the country a global hub for crypto while promoting consumer protections.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United States’ new approach to stablecoin regulation is reshaping global liquidity flows and driving a sharp structural split with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime, effectively creating separate US and EU stablecoin liquidity pools, according to a new report from blockchain security auditor CertiK. The report finds that the US digital asset market entered a new phase of regulatory clarity in 2025, with federal legislation and administrative reforms now broadly aligned around how digital assets are issued, traded and custodied. At the center of that shift is the GENIUS Act , signed into law by US President Donald Trump in July, which establishes the first federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law imposes strict reserve requirements, bans yield-bearing stablecoins , and formally integrates stablecoin issuers into the US financial system. While the framework provides long-sought regulatory certainty for US issuers, the report warns that it also accelerates global divergence with the EU’s MiCA regime, leaving the US with a “distinct liquidity pool” and effectively fracturing the global stablecoin market. As a result, CertiK expects stablecoin liquidity to become increasingly segmented by jurisdiction, introducing new cross-border settlement frictions and potentially opening the door to regional stablecoin arbitrage.

Source: CertiK Related: Crypto Biz: Corporate stablecoin race heats up with Citi, Western Union at the helm MiCA draws fire over banking risk as US sees stablecoins as statecraft While the European Union’s MiCA regime mirrors the US GENIUS Act in requiring full redemption at par and banning yield on stablecoins, it has drawn criticism for introducing banking concentration risk, as the rules require a majority of issuer reserves to be held inside EU-based banks. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told Cointelegraph that this structure could introduce “systemic risks” for issuers , noting that banks typically lend out a significant share of their deposits under the fractional reserve system. Others, including Anastasija Plotnikova, founder of Fideum, have warned that MiCA’s framework could also accelerate industry consolidation, raising barriers to entry for smaller issuers due to higher compliance and capital costs. Nevertheless, neither the GENIUS Act nor MiCA appears designed to preserve global stablecoin fungibility. Instead, both frameworks prioritize regulatory oversight and financial stability, while, in the case of the United States, explicitly reinforcing dollar liquidity and global dollar usage . That view was reinforced earlier this year by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , who said the administration would take a deliberate approach to stablecoin regulation and use it as a tool to extend US dollar dominance. “As President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that,” Bessent said.

According to a Monday report by local news outlet Kommersant, Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said the regulator is discussing easing regulations for cryptocurrencies.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki declined to sign a bill imposing strict regulations on the crypto asset market, drawing praise from the crypto community and sharp criticism from others in the government. Nawrocki vetoed Poland’s Crypto-Asset Market Act, saying its provisions “genuinely threaten the freedoms of Poles, their property, and the stability of the state,” according to a statement by the president’s press office on Monday. Introduced in June, the bill has drawn criticism from industry advocates such as Polish politician Tomasz Mentzen, who had anticipated the president’s refusal to sign it as it cleared parliamentary approval. Although crypto advocates welcomed the veto as a win for the market, several government officials condemned the move, claiming the president had “chosen chaos” and must bear full responsibility for the outcome. Why the president vetoed the bill One of the main reasons cited for the veto was a provision allowing authorities to easily block websites operating in the crypto market. “Domain blocking laws are opaque and can lead to abuse,” the president’s office said in an official news release. The president’s office also cited the bill’s widely criticized length, saying its complexity reduces transparency and would lead to “overregulation,” especially when compared with simpler frameworks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Source: Press office of Polish President Karol Nawrocki (post translated by X) “Overregulation is an easy way to drive companies to the Czech Republic, Lithuania or Malta, rather than create conditions for them to operate and pay taxes in Poland,” the president said. Nawrocki also highlighted the excessive amount of supervisory fees, which may prevent startup activity and favor foreign corporations and banks. “This is a reversal of logic, killing off a competitive market and a serious threat to innovation,” he said. Critics jump in: “The president chose chaos” Nawrocki’s veto has triggered a strong backlash from top Polish officials, including Finance Minister Andrzej Domański and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski. Domański warned on X that “already now 20% of clients are losing their money as a result of abuses in this market,” accusing the president of having “chosen chaos” and saying he bears full responsibility for the fallout. Related: Spain’s junior ruling party proposes 47% crypto tax in ‘attack against Bitcoin’ Sikorski echoed the concern, saying that the bill was supposed to regulate the crypto market. “When the bubble bursts and thousands of Poles lose their savings, at least they will know who to thank,” Sikorski argued on X.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Japanese government is reportedly backing plans to introduce a significant reduction in the nation’s maximum tax rate on crypto profits, with a flat rate of 20% across the board. Japan’s financial regulator , the Financial Services Agency (FSA), first floated the proposed tax changes in mid-November, outlining plans to introduce a bill in early 2026, and now the government and ruling coalition — the political parties in control of Japan’s parliament, the National Diet — are on board. According to a report from Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia on Sunday, the new rules aim to align crypto taxation rules with those of other financial products, such as equities and investment funds. Under the current laws, taxation on crypto trading is included as part of income taxes for individuals and businesses, falling under the category of “miscellaneous income.” The rate ranges from 5% on the lower end of the spectrum to 45% on the high end, with high-income earners potentially on the hook for an additional 10% inhabitant tax. Meanwhile, assets such as equities and investment trusts are taxed separately, with a flat 20% tax on profits, regardless of the amount. The tax changes could be a boon for the domestic cryptocurrency market, as the higher tax rates may have deterred potential investors. Source: Sota Watanabe According to the Nikkei report, the potential changes to crypto taxation in Japan will be introduced as part of a “solid investor-protection framework” proposed in the FSA’s bill, which aims to amend the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The FSA will submit the bill during the regular Diet session in 2026, as it pushes for greater oversight of crypto trading, including a ban on dealing with non-public information and stricter investment disclosures. Japan finally set for crypto tax change after long fight The Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), the nation’s major crypto-focused non-governmental lobbying group, has been calling for these changes for almost three years. Related: Bitcoin falls to $84K: Is Japan’s bond market the culprit, or is more at play? In July 2023, the JBA published a letter to the government on its website, outlining key tax reform requests to support the industry. The letter called for a 20% tax rate that aligns with other investment vehicles. “This letter requests a review of tax on crypto assets, which is the biggest hurdle for companies operating Web3 businesses in Japan and a disincentive for the public to actively own and use crypto assets,” the letter reads. While it is unclear if the JBA had a direct influence on the FSA’s thinking, the financial watchdog did start warming up to the idea and pushing for reform in September 2024.

Claims of debanking by regulators with the FDIC, Fed, OCC and SEC Many individuals connected to the cryptocurrency industry or who hold digital assets have reported receiving letters from financial institutions saying that they would no longer be allowed to use their services. According to the report, “at least 30 entities and individuals engaging in digital asset-related activities” were debanked in some fashion by US regulators under the Biden administration. Among the measures, the report claimed that regulators enacted to debank crypto companies or individuals included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sending “pause” letters for financial institutions to encourage clients to sever ties to digital assets, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) laying out “additional red tape for digital asset-related activities,” and the Securities and Exchange Commission using “regulation by enforcement tactics” to target crypto companies. Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump’s administration has scaled back or removed regulations impacting the cryptocurrency industry, through executive orders on debanking and with his picks directing activities at the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and SEC.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED South Korean lawmakers are pressing financial regulators to deliver a draft stablecoin bill by a deadline set for later this month, as disagreements over the role of banks continue to stall progress. According to a Monday report by a local news outlet, Maeil Business Newspaper, South Korea’s ruling party sent a “last-minute notice” to financial regulators to submit a stablecoin regulatory framework draft by Dec. 10. Kang Joon-hyun, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, said, “If the government bill does not come over within this deadline, we will take a drive through legislation by the secretary of the political affairs committee.” If it is delivered in time, he expects the bill will be discussed at the extraordinary session of the National Assembly in January 2026. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) later issued a statement saying “no decision had been finalized regarding the formation of a consortium for issuing a KRW-denominated stablecoin.” The regulator confirmed that stablecoin regulation was discussed on Monday during a ruling party–government consultation, and both sides agreed to prepare the government bill as quickly as possible.

Source: Wikimedia Related: South Korea targets sub-$680 crypto transfers in sweeping AML crackdown No agreement yet on bank-led model Despite earlier reports, “no concrete decision has been made on matters such as allowing a consortium in which banks hold 51% or more of equity,” the FSC said. The news follows late November reports that South Korea is likely to end the year without a framework for locally issued stablecoins, amid ongoing disputes over the role of banks in stablecoin issuance. The Bank of Korea (BOK) and other financial regulators clashed over the extent of banks’ involvement in issuing Korean won-pegged stablecoins. The central bank expected banks to own at least 51% of any stablecoin issuer seeking regulatory approval in the country, while regulators want a more diverse ecosystem. Related: South Korea ramps up crypto seizures, will target cold wallets Why a majority bank ownership? A BOK official said at the time that banks “are already under regulatory oversight and have extensive experience handling Anti-Money Laundering protocols,” making them a good option for a stablecoin issuer. Sangmin Seo, the chair of the Kaia DLT Foundation, told Cointelegraph in late October that the central bank’s argument for banks leading a rollout “ seems to lack a logical foundation .” He argued that a better solution would be to establish clear rules for issuers instead. He added: “It would be even more valuable if the Bank of Korea could provide guidelines on how these risks can be mitigated and what qualifications are required for an issuer to be regarded as trustworthy.“ This was discussed again during Monday’s meeting, with an official from Kang’s office saying that the ruling party was “looking for a point of contact, considering both the stability of the BOK’s monetary policy and the industrial innovation emphasized by the [FSC]”.

The odds of Hassett filling the seat have spiked to 66% on Polymarket and 74% on Kalshi at the time of writing. Hassett is widely viewed as crypto‑friendly thanks to his past role on Coinbase’s advisory council, a disclosed seven‑figure stake in the exchange and his leadership of the White House digital asset working group.​ Founder and CEO of Wyoming-based Custodia Bank, and a prominent advocate for crypto-friendly regulations, Caitlin Long, commented on X: “If this comes true & Hassett does become Fed chairman, anti-#crypto people at the Fed who still hold positions of power will finally be out (well, most of them anyway).

His financial disclosure reveals at least a seven‑figure Coinbase stake and compensation for serving on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council, placing him unusually close to the crypto industry for a potential Fed chair.​ Still, crypto has been burned before by reading too much into “crypto‑literate” resumes. Gary Gensler arrived at the Securities and Exchange Commission with MIT blockchain courses under his belt, but went on to preside over a wave of high‑profile enforcement actions, some of which critics branded as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 .” A Hassett-led Fed might be more open to experimentation and less reflexively hostile to bank‑crypto activity. Still, the institution’s mandate on financial stability means markets should not assume a one‑way bet on deregulation.​ Related: Caitlin Long’s crypto bank loses appeal over Fed master account Supervision pushback inside the Fed The Hassett odds have jumped just as the Fed’s own approach to bank supervision has received pushback from veterans like Fed Governor Michael Barr, who earned his reputation as one of Operation Chokepoint 2.0’s key architects. According to Caitlin Long, while he Barr “was Vice Chairman of Supervision & Regulation he did Warren’s bidding,” and he “has made it clear he will oppose changes made by Trump & his appointees.” On Nov. 18, the Fed released new Supervisory Operating Principles that shift examiners toward a “risk‑first” framework, directing staff to focus on material safety‑and‑soundness risks rather than procedural or documentation issues. In a speech the same day, Barr warned that narrowing oversight, weakening ratings frameworks and making it harder to issue enforcement actions or matters requiring attention could leave supervisors slower to act on emerging risks, arguing that gutting those tools may repeat pre‑crisis mistakes.​ Days later, in Consumer Affairs Letter 25‑1, the Fed clarified that the new Supervisory Operating Principles do not apply to its Consumer Affairs supervision program (an area under Barr’s committee as a governor). If prediction markets are right and a crypto‑friendly Hassett inherits this landscape, his Fed would not be writing on a blank slate but stepping into an institution already mid‑pivot on how hard (and where) it leans on banks.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japanese government bond yields have jumped to their highest level in decades, prompting some analysts to speculate that it could be behind the recent crypto market sell-off on Sunday. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield hit 1.86% on Monday, its highest level since April 2008, according to MarketWatch. Yields in the 10-year bonds have almost doubled in Japan over the past 12 months. Japan’s two-year bond yields also hit 1% for the first time since 2008. While 1.86% is not a substantial yield from government bonds, it is significant because it marks a shift, as Japan has had a very low interest rate environment for decades, with negative or close to zero rates prevailing for the most part, and a very stable bond market. This has encouraged institutional investors around the world to borrow low-interest Japanese yen to buy higher-yielding, riskier assets, in a strategy known as the “ Yen Carry Trade .” “Trillions borrowed in yen, deployed into US Treasurys, European bonds, emerging market debt, risk assets everywhere,” explained economics author Shanaka Anslem Perera, who said, “That anchor is now breaking.” Japan's 10-year bond prices hit their highest level since 2008. Source: MarketWatch Japan’s bond yield hike is bad timing for US Japanese institutions hold approximately $1.1 trillion in US Treasury securities, and is the largest foreign position, explained Perera. “When domestic yields rise from nothing to nearly 2%, the math changes.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) and cryptocurrencies typically thrive in an era of ultra-loose monetary policy and low interest rates globally. When Japan provided an abundance of cheap money through the carry trade, some of that capital flowed into riskier assets, such as crypto and US tech stocks. If that liquidity reverses and flows back to Japan, there will be less speculative capital available for crypto markets. “Crypto is usually the first place where all of this shows up. It sits at the highest end of the risk spectrum, so even small shifts in liquidity lead to sharp moves,” said DeFi market analyst “Wukong.” If global bond markets reprice violently, investors typically flee to safety first, resulting in a sell-off of all risk assets as people scramble for cash and liquidity.

Castro’s comments followed a rough month for BlackRock’s US-listed IBIT, which logged an estimated $2.34 billion in net outflows across November. The two largest withdrawals came mid-month, with about $523 million leaving on Nov. 18 and roughly $463 million on Nov. 14. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments,” Castro reportedly said after his panel at the Blockchain Conference 2025. “They exist to let people allocate capital and manage cash flow.
