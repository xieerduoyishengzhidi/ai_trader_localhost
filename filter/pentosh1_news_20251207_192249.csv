Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Commission’s proposal to expand the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is raising concerns about the centralization of the bloc’s licensing regime, despite signaling deeper institutional ambitions for its capital markets structure. On Thursday, the Commission published a package proposing to “direct supervisory competences” for key pieces of market infrastructure, including crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), trading venues and central counterparties to ESMA , Cointelegraph reported. Concerningly, the ESMA’s jurisdiction would extend to both the supervision and licensing of all European crypto and financial technology (fintech) firms, potentially leading to slower licensing regimes and hindering startup development, according to Faustine Fleuret, head of public affairs at decentralized lending protocol Morpho. “I am even more concerned that the proposal makes ESMA responsible for both the authorisation and the supervision of CASPs, not only the supervision,” she told Cointelegraph. The proposal still requires approval from the European Parliament and the Council, which are currently under negotiation. If adopted, ESMA’s role in overseeing EU capital markets would more closely resemble the centralized framework of the US Securities and Exchange Commission , a concept first proposed by European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde in 2023.

""Without adequate resources, this mandate may become unmanageable, leading to delays or overly cautious assessments that could disproportionately affect smaller or innovative firms."" “Ultimately, the effectiveness of this reform will depend less on its legal form and more on its institutional execution,” including ESMA’s operational capacity, independence and cooperation “channels” with member states, she said.

Improving liquidity conditions and rising odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut may catalyze a recovery in the crypto market during December, according to Coinbase Institutional. “We think crypto could be poised for a December recovery as liquidity improves, Fed cut odds jump to 92% (as of Dec 4), and macro tailwinds build,” wrote Coinbase in a Friday research report. In October, Coinbase predicted “weakness” in the crypto market ahead of a “December reversal,” based on its custom global M2 money supply index, which measures the total outstanding fiat currency supply.

Bitcoin's ( BTC ) prospects for the first quarter of 2026 may hinge more on the remarks of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau educational platform. He told Cointelegraph: ""If the Fed cuts rates on December 10th, along with ending QT, there's little standing in the way of a Santa rally for Bitcoin - bar any major geopolitical bombshell.” “However, investors will scrutinise Jerome Powell’s every word during the press conference to get a glimpse into 2026 monetary policy, and any hawkishness could put a lid on the rally,” he said.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED On Thursday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) products will begin trading for the first time on its registered futures exchanges. Here are three reasons why this is a big deal for the top two cryptocurrencies heading into 2026. Key takeaways : CFTC oversight gives BTC and ETH gold-like legitimacy, opening the door to larger institutional flows. Regulated US trading boosts liquidity, cuts volatility, and shifts crypto activity back onshore. Bitcoin and Ethereum can scale like gold One of the strongest historical parallels for the CFTC decision came from the gold market . When gold was formally opened to trading on regulated US futures exchanges in the 1970s, the shift transformed it from a fragmented, over-the-counter commodity into a globally recognized investment asset. Liquidity concentrated on COMEX, institutions entered for the first time, and transparent price discovery created a foundation for long-term capital flows. Since its COMEX debut, spot gold prices gained 4,000%, illustrating how regulatory clarity can reshape an asset’s market trajectory. XAU/USD yearly performance chart. Source: TradingView The CFTC placed Bitcoin and Ethereum under a similar commodity framework with its latest announcement, thus removing the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) issuer-focused requirements. It also filled a long-standing gap: US traders could access crypto on platforms like Coinbase and Kraken but lacked regulated spot leverage, deep liquidity tools, or exchange-level protections. That absence forced liquidity offshore, with recent 2025 data showing Binance capturing roughly 41.1% of global spot activity, far ahead of US-based venues. With regulated spot markets now approved domestically, Bitcoin and Ethereum gain the same structural foundation that helped gold evolve from a niche hedge into a mature, globally traded asset class. Source: X CFTC improves institutional exposure for BTC, ETH Pension funds, banks, and hedge funds that previously sat on the sidelines can now treat Bitcoin and Ethereum like other CFTC-recognized commodities, with standardized rules, surveillance, and custody requirements.

What pension funds are starting to discover 86% of institutional investors already have or plan to gain crypto exposure, and most increased their allocations in 2024 as US regulation improved, according to a joint survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon in January. Source: X A majority also preferred accessing crypto through regulated investment rails, such as commodity exchanges or ETFs, rather than offshore venues. Following the CFTC decision, institutions can now access Bitcoin and Ethereum through regulated exchanges, audited custody, and supervised pricing, setting the stage for stronger, more durable mainstream adoption. Bitcoin, Ether may see better liquidity growth Historical evidence suggested that commodities expanded rapidly after debuting on regulated trading venues. A case in point is the launch of WTI oil futures in 1983, whose trading exploded from just 3,000 contracts in the first month to over 100,000 per month within a year, and then to over 2 million contracts per month by the late 1980s. WTI two-week chart. Source: TradingView Today, WTI often exceeds a million contracts in daily volume, a testament to how regulation can foster colossal market growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum can witness a similar liquidity boost, with CFTC-approved spot trading likely to attract many more US traders and market makers, thus increasing order book depth and reducing spreads. Deep liquidity and robust volume on US soil can also reduce volatility over time , as large buy or sell orders are more easily absorbed.

The IPO could come as early as next month, with Goldman Sachs lined up to lead the offering, the Financial Times reported , citing people familiar with the matter. One source reportedly told the FT that the deal is unlikely to price before January. Founded in 2018, Clear Street rose to prominence as dozens of public companies began adopting the “crypto treasury” playbook, raising capital through equity or debt markets and using the proceeds to buy large quantities of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The strategy was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has accumulated 650,000 BTC through multiple stock and convertible offerings underwritten in part by Clear Street. The firm also served as an underwriter for Trump Media and Technology Group, which has signaled plans to raise billions to establish a Bitcoin treasury operation of its own. According to its website, Clear Street has underwritten about $91 billion in combined equity, debt and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions so far this year, including deals for well-known crypto advocates Anthony Pompliano and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin treasury companies are entering a “Darwinian phase” as the core mechanics of their once-booming business model break down, according to a new analysis from Galaxy Research. The report said that the digital asset treasury (DAT) trade has reached its natural limit as equity prices fell below Bitcoin ( BTC ) net asset value (NAV), causing the issuance-driven growth loop to reverse and turning leverage into a liability. That breaking point arrived as Bitcoin dropped from its October peak near $126,000 to lows around $80,000, triggering a sharp contraction in risk appetite and draining liquidity across the market. The October 10 deleveraging event accelerated the shift, wiping out open interest across futures markets and weakening spot depth. “For treasury companies whose equities had been serving as leveraged crypto trades, the shift has been intense,” Galaxy said, adding that the “same financial engineering that amplified upside has magnified downside.” Related: Cantor slashes Strategy target by 60%, tells clients forced-sale fears are overblown DAT stocks flip to discounts DAT stocks that traded at rich premiums to NAV over the summer are now mostly at discounts, even as Bitcoin itself is down only around 30% from highs. Companies such as Metaplanet and Nakamoto, which previously showed hundreds of millions in unrealized gains, are now deep in the red as average BTC purchase prices sit above $107,000. Galaxy noted that the leverage embedded in these firms is exposing them to extreme downside, with one firm, NAKA, plunging more than 98% from its peak. “This price action resembles the kind of wipeouts seen in memecoin markets,” the firm wrote. Metaplanet’s unrealized PnL reaches $530 million. Source: Galaxy With issuance no longer available, Galaxy outlined three possible paths from here. The base case is a prolonged period of compressed premiums, during which BTC-per-share growth stagnates and DAT equities offer more downside than Bitcoin itself. A second outcome is consolidation, when firms that issued heavily at high premiums, bought BTC near the top, or loaded up on debt, face solvency pressure and may be acquired or restructured. A third scenario leaves room for recovery if Bitcoin eventually reaches new all-time highs, but only for companies that preserved liquidity and avoided over-issuing during the boom.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: The Federal Reserve’s move away from quantitative tightening and rate cuts creates liquidity, making fixed-income assets less attractive. Surging tech credit risks, as evidenced by high Oracle debt protection costs, prompt investors to seek alternative, scarcer assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell 4% on Friday to a low of $88,140, extending its decline to 19% since November. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is now less than 1% from its all-time high. This sharp divergence may soon close with a strong upside move for Bitcoin, fueled by a major shift in central bank policy and growing credit stress. This perfect storm has the potential to propel Bitcoin to the psychologically critical $100,000 barrier before the year concludes. Fixed income’s fading appeal and tech credit scare could fuel Bitcoin rally The most critical factor is the Federal Reserve’s pivot from quantitative tightening , a process of draining liquidity from the financial system by allowing the maturity of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities without reinvesting the proceeds.

According to Bloomberg, there is now a record-high $8 trillion in US money-market funds. Credit Default Swaps for Oracle’s debt. Source: Bloomberg The potential capital rotation is further incentivized by structural risks emerging in the equity markets, especially in the tech sector. The cost of protecting Oracle’s (ORCL) debt against default using Credit Default Swaps has surged to its highest level since 2009. Oracle had $105 billion of debt, including leases, as of the end of August.

Bank of America says steady Fed rates increase economic slowdown odds Investors fear this high-stakes push, which includes US President Donald Trump’s Genesis Mission, a national initiative aimed at doubling US scientific productivity through the use of AI and nuclear energy. The surge in demand for debt protection signals extreme market unease regarding the immense debt-fueled spending, which may not yield adequate returns. Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett argued that if the Fed sends a message of steady interest rates, the odds of a wider economic slowdown significantly increase. This uncertainty, combined with a desire for growth less dependent on stimulus, reinforces the appeal of Bitcoin's scarcity as institutional capital looks to de-risk its traditional tech exposures. The Fed’s official end to its liquidity drain program and the market’s aggressive pricing of interest rate cuts provide a monumental tailwind. With tech credit risks surging due to massive AI-related debt, capital is structurally primed to rotate into scarce assets. This convergence establishes a clear path for BTC to breach the $100,000 milestone over the next couple of months.

In 2025, that long-standing roadmap is beginning to look outdated — and analysts are seeking a new framework to understand where Bitcoin ( BTC ) is headed next. Some argue that institutional capital is reshaping the market. Others highlight the weakening impact of the halving, the rise of AI as a competing investment frontier, or global liquidity trends that no longer line up with old patterns. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be moving like it used to. In this exclusive Cointelegraph interview, Jeff Park, partner and chief investment officer at ProCap BTC, challenges the assumptions behind the four-year cycle, claiming that Bitcoin may now be transitioning into a much shorter, more dynamic two-year cycle. Park argues that Bitcoin’s market structure has undergone a fundamental shift as institutional flows operate under different incentives than those of retail investors. At the core of Park’s argument is a provocative idea: Shorter cycles could dramatically reshape how investors think about timing, volatility and Bitcoin’s potential path through 2026. Park also touches on why some players prefer short-term weakness, how liquidity patterns intersect with the new cycle and what this shift could mean for the next major move.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The lower house of Poland’s parliament failed to secure the required three-fifths majority to override President Karol Nawrocki’s veto of the Crypto-Asset Market Act, pushing the country further away from regulating its digital-asset sector at a moment when lawmakers argue that oversight is increasingly urgent. As Bloomberg reported Friday, the legislation — advanced by Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s government — was intended to align Poland with the European Union’s MiCA framework for crypto markets. The bill was introduced in June but did not survive the president’s veto. Nawrocki blocked the measure last week, arguing it would “threaten the freedoms of Poles, their property, and the stability of the state,” as Cointelegraph previously reported . With the president’s veto upheld, the bill will not move forward, forcing the government to restart its crypto lawmaking process. Source: Kancelaria Prezydenta RP The proposal has sharply divided lawmakers and the crypto industry. Supporters framed the bill as a national security priority, saying that comprehensive rules are necessary to curb fraud and prevent potential misuse of crypto assets by foreign actors, including Russia, according to Bloomberg. However, several crypto-industry groups opposed the legislation, warning that its requirements were overly burdensome and could drive startups out of the country. Critics pointed to stringent licensing rules , high compliance costs and criminal-liability provisions for service-provider executives, arguing that the bill risked stifling innovation and creating an uncompetitive business environment.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED US attorneys representing the federal government have requested that a judge send Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to prison for 12 years at his sentencing hearing next week. In a Thursday filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, prosecutors asked that a judge sentence Kwon “to a term of twelve years’ imprisonment and finalize the forfeiture of his criminal proceeds.” The filing came about four months after the Terraform co-founder pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. “In just a few years, Kwon caused losses that eclipsed those caused by Samuel Bankman-Fried [...] Alexander Mashinsky [...] and Karl Sebastian Greenwood [....] combined [emphasis included in filing],” said the Thursday filing. “The Terraform market crash triggered a cascade of crises that swept through cryptocurrency markets and contributed to what has since become known as ‘Crypto Winter.’” Source: Courtlistener Kwon, who is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday, was indicted by US authorities in March 2023 for charges including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering and wire fraud related to his role at Terraform. Though his whereabouts were initially unknown after the collapse of Terra in 2022, authorities in Montenegro arrested him on charges unrelated to his role at the company, and he was later extradited to the US. Related: South Korea targets sub-$680 crypto transfers in sweeping AML crackdown The price of Terra’s native token, LUNA, surged by more than 40% in the previous 24 hours amid the release of the sentencing recommendation, from about $0.07 to $0.10 at the time of publication. However, the token reached an all-time high price of more than $19.00 before the ecosystem collapsed in May 2022. Kwon says he could still face prison time in South Korea In a November court filing, lawyers representing Kwon asked that the Terraform co-founder be given a sentence of no more than five years. His attorneys presented several arguments in favor of a shorter sentence, including that the co-founder could face 40 years in prison in his native South Korea, where prosecutors are also working on a case against him. “He would not be able to walk out of jail in the United States as a free man for any amount of time: He will be taken from whatever facility in which he serves his sentence directly to an immigration detention center to await a deportation flight to Seoul, where he will immediately reenter pretrial detention pending his criminal charges in South Korea,” said Kwon’s lawyers. Although Kwon’s and prosecutors’ respective recommendations will remain under consideration, the judge overseeing the sentencing hearing has the authority to sentence the Terraform co-founder to decades in prison, or a significantly shorter time. In contrast, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after his conviction on seven felony charges, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and a judge sent Karl Sebastian Greenwood to prison for 20 years for his role in the OneCoin scheme.

EU banks launch euro-stablecoin firm as EU considers ESMA crypto oversight A group of 10 European banks, including institutional heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, is planning to launch a stablecoin backed by the euro by the second half of 2026. BNP Paribas partnered with Danish Danske Bank, the Netherlands’ ING, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International and others to create and incorporate the project as Qivalis. The company will be based in Amsterdam. Qivalis CEO Jan-Oliver Sell said that stablecoins provide both convenience and monetary autonomy “in the digital age.” He said it will give “new opportunities for European companies and consumers to interact with on-chain payments and digital asset markets in their own currency.” The new project was announced days before the European Commission proposed expanding the powers of the EU’s key financial regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The proposal , released Thursday, would transfer supervision “over significant market infrastructures such as certain trading venues, Central Counterparties (CCPs), CSDs, and all Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs)” to the ESMA. The move is part of a broader effort to streamline European market regulation. Three countries — France, Italy and Austria — have requested that the ESMA take over crypto regulations. This followed concerns that there was uneven enforcement of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) standards across member states. Related: What is Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)?

South Africa flags crypto risks; new rules in the works The South African Reserve Bank, the country’s central bank, issued a warning on Nov. 25 about the perceived risks associated with stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. These include a lack of comprehensive regulations. The bank was concerned that the global and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies would make them ideal for skirting financial regulations. South Africa is second on the continent for value received in crypto. Source: Chainalysis Herco Steyn, the bank’s lead macroprudential specialist, reportedly said the risk stemmed from “the lack of a complementary and full regulatory framework, which is not possible at the moment.” In 2023, he wrote , “Regulatory influence over stablecoin issuers – whether domiciled domestically or abroad – may result in spillovers from the crypto asset ecosystem to the traditional financial system, particularly if South African regulatory authorities are unable to impose prudential requirements on stablecoin issuers.” To address this, the reserve bank is reportedly working on new rules with the National Treasury to monitor cross-border crypto transactions and change exchange control laws so they fall under regulatory scrutiny. IMF warns stablecoins could upend fragile financial systems On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a report on stablecoins outlining a number of risks, including: Volatility in value and runs Disintermediation of banks Interconnection with the financial system Currency substitution. It said that the “use of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins, especially in cross-border contexts, could lead to currency substitution and potentially undermine monetary sovereignty, particularly in the presence of unhosted wallets.” The IMF also noted that many major stablecoin issuers don’t provide or offer any redemption rights for holders. “Uncertainty of treatment in case of insolvency of stablecoin issuer may also accelerate runs,” it said. Runs would also create first-mover advantages when there is a crisis of confidence, which could result in investors selling their holdings at a significant discount. The IMF did acknowledge possible benefits of stablecoins, including faster transactions compared to bank transfers, particularly in the context of cross-border transactions and remittances. They can also facilitate digital payment in remote areas and reduce counterparty risk when integrated with smart contracts.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Strategy (MSTR) won’t be forced to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat if its share price drops, and those who say otherwise are “just flat wrong,” says Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. “There is nothing about MSTR’s price dropping below NAV [net asset value] that will force it to sell,” Hougan argued in a note on Tuesday, pointing to chairman Michael Saylor’s steadfast conviction in Bitcoin ( BTC ). “It would indeed be very bad for the Bitcoin market if MSTR had to sell its $60 billion of Bitcoin in one go — that’s akin to two years of Bitcoin ETF inflows,” Hougan said. “But with no debt due until 2027 and enough cash to cover interest payments for the foreseeable future, I just don’t see it happening.” Fears that Strategy could sell its massive Bitcoin haul flared after the company’s CEO, Phong Le, said last week that it could offload some of its stash as a “last resort” if Strategy’s market value slipped below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Source: Matt Hougan If that happened, and Strategy’s financing options dried up, Le said it would be justifiable to offload some Bitcoin to protect the firm’s “Bitcoin yield per share.” Strategy is also facing a lengthy crypto market slump , along with a potential delisting from the MSCI stock market index. Strategy can weather the storm, Hougan says Hougan said that Strategy’s situation is not dire enough to start selling Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency trading around $92,000 is “24% above the average price at which Strategy acquired its stash ($74,436).” He added the company has a lot of leeway even if its stock drops below its NAV, as Strategy’s books show no near-term pressure that would force it to sell Bitcoin. “MSTR has two relevant obligations on its debt: It needs to pay about $800 million a year in interest and it needs to convert or roll over specific debt instruments as they come due,” he said. “The interest payments are not a near-term concern. The company has $1.4 billion in cash, meaning it can make its dividend payments easily for a year and a half,” he added. Related: Can the biggest Bitcoin whales really decide when the market turns green or red? Over the past 30 days, MSTR has declined 24.69%, ending trading on Friday at $186.01. Part of that downward pressure on the price may be a result of the announcement in October from Morgan Stanley Capital International, which stated that it may exclude from its indices digital asset treasury companies that have balance sheets with more than 50% crypto assets. Such a move would force index-tracking funds to sell, putting even more pressure on MSTR. Hougan doesn’t believe that will ultimately have a significant impact on sentiment toward Strategy or its share price, arguing that historically, such occurrences have been less impactful than expected. “My experience from watching index additions and deletions over the years is that the effect is typically smaller than you think and priced in well ahead of time,” he said. “When MSTR was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index last December, funds tracking the index had to buy $2.1 billion of the stock.

On Thursday, the Sui Foundation announced that 21Shares has launched its 2x leveraged SUI ( SUI ) ETF, trading under the ticker TXXS on the Nasdaq. The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily return of SUI, giving investors a way to gain leveraged exposure without directly holding the cryptocurrency. In practical terms, if SUI rises 10% in a single day, the ETF aims to rise by about 20%. Losses are similarly magnified on the downside. Rather than holding SUI tokens , the fund utilizes derivatives, including swaps and other financial contracts, to track the price movements of the token.

On Oct. 10, the crypto market saw its largest leverage-driven sell-off on record , with roughly $19 billion worth of positions liquidated as prices fell rapidly and forced highly leveraged traders out of their positions. The fallout extended beyond leveraged traders to spot investors as well, who saw the value of their holdings decline in the weeks that followed. Bitcoin ( BTC ), for example, fell from a record high near $126,000 in October to below $80,000 in November. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Leverage plays a significantly larger role in crypto markets compared to traditional markets, largely due to the widespread use of derivatives exchanges and perpetual futures contracts.

In the “Understanding Stablecoins” report released on Thursday, the IMF analyzed the various approaches regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union, had taken in establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Although the report noted that emerging regulations could mitigate risks to macrofinancial stability, the landscape was “fragmented,” both in policymakers’ approaches and how stablecoins are issued. “The proliferation of new stablecoins across different blockchains and exchanges raises concerns about inefficiencies due to potential lack of interoperability,” said the IMF. “Moreover, this can introduce differences and roadblocks among countries, due to different regulatory treatment and transaction hurdles.” The IMF added: “Although regulation of stablecoins helps authorities address [certain] risks, strong macro-policies and robust institutions [...] should be the first line of defense [...] International coordination remains key to solving these issues.” Source: IMF The report said that two of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Tether’s USDT ( USDt ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) were “backed mostly” by short-term US Treasurys, reverse repo collateralized with US Treasurys, and bank deposits. Forty percent of USDC’s reserves and about 75% of USDt’s reserves consisted of short-term US Treasurys, with Tether’s stablecoin also holding 5% of its reserves in Bitcoin ( BTC ).

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Market maker Citadel Securities has recommended that the Securities and Exchange Commission tighten regulations on decentralized finance when it comes to tokenized stocks, causing backlash from crypto users. Citadel Securities told the SEC in a letter on Tuesday that DeFi developers, smart-contract coders, and self-custody wallet providers should not be given “broad exemptive relief” for offering trading of tokenized US equities. It argued that DeFi trading platforms likely fall under the definitions of an “exchange” or “broker-dealer” and should be regulated under securities laws if offering tokenized stocks. “Granting broad exemptive relief to facilitate the trading of a tokenized share via DeFi protocols would create two separate regulatory regimes for the trading of the same security,” it argued. “This outcome would be the exact opposite of the “technology-neutral” approach taken by the Exchange Act.” Citadel’s letter, made in response to the SEC looking for feedback on how it should approach regulating tokenized stocks , has drawn considerable backlash from the crypto community and organizations advocating for innovation in the blockchain space. Crypto users, Blockchain Association hits out “Whoever thought Citadel would be against innovation that removes predatory, rent-seeking intermediaries from the financial system?” asked lawyer and Blockchain Association board member Jake Chervinsky on Thursday. “Oh, right, literally every single person in crypto,” he added. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams added that it “makes sense the king of shady TradFi market makers doesn’t like open source, peer-to-peer tech that can lower the barrier to liquidity creation.” Summer Mersinger , CEO of the crypto advocacy group the Blockchain Association, said that “regulating software developers as if they were financial intermediaries would undermine US competitiveness, drive innovation offshore, and do nothing to advance investor protection.” Source: Blockchain Association “We urge the SEC to reject this overbroad and unworkable approach and instead focus regulatory attention on actual intermediaries who stand between users and their assets,” she added.

It argued that recent disruptions in crypto markets, including the October flash crash, were “timely reminders of why long-standing securities regulatory frameworks designed to preserve market quality and protect investors were originally created.” The statement echoes the stance the trade group took in July, rejecting any SEC exemptive relief for blockchain and DeFi platforms that issue tokenized assets.

He added: “If you bought [Bitcoin] for a trade, it’s a very volatile asset. You’re going to have to be really good at market timing, which most people aren’t.” Fink’s comments stand in stark contrast to those he made in October 2017, before Bitcoin’s well-known bull run that drove the price of the cryptocurrency to then all-time highs.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A new, more moderate tax on digital assets in Japan is projected to make crypto more appealing to retail investors. Lawmakers in the National Diet, Japan’s legislature, reportedly support a proposal from the country’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), that would lower taxes on crypto. The rate would decrease from a maximum of 55% to 20%, aligning the taxation regime more closely with traditional assets and securities. Relaxing the tax code reflects a growing trend of the government moderating its stance toward crypto in Japan. From a relative gray zone to strict regulations, to becoming part of a national growth plan, the government has gradually recognized crypto as part of the financial industry. This growing recognition, soon to take the form of lower taxes for crypto traders, will onboard new retail users, industry observers state. More retail investors to come with lower crypto tax in Japan For years, cryptocurrencies operated in a somewhat gray space in Japan. After the collapse of the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange in 2014, the Diet decided that digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) were not to be considered currency or bonds. Therefore, they could not be regulated under the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. This effectively prohibited banks and companies dealing in securities from offering cryptocurrency-related services. In May 2016, the FSA established a regulatory regime for crypto-asset service providers under the Payment Services Act (PSA). Subsequent amendments to the PSA in 2017 legalized crypto and created standards for exchanges. These included Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your Customer and registration requirements. The amendments also labelled crypto as “miscellaneous income.” The progressive income tax rates in Japan range from 5% to 45%. Combined with a flat 10% inhabitant tax, the maximum tax penalty for crypto adds up to 55%. Related: An overview of cryptocurrency regulations in Japan The proposed flat capital gains tax of 20% would bring digital asset taxation more in line with traditional financial instruments. In doing so, market observers believe more retail investors will jump into crypto. This table was compiled and published in September 2023. Sota Watanabe, CEO of blockchain development firm Startale, said that it’s “a big day [for] Japan [...] . If approved this year, likely crypto ETFs and tax deduction from up to 55% to 20% come. I am 100% sure more Japanese people come onchain.” Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at crypto venture fund Dragonfly, said that the high tax rate in Japan has resulted in “relatively low retail trading volume today, and few world-stage crypto companies.” But with a GDP close to Germany and India, this makes Japan a “sleeping giant in crypto.” The main culprit, said Qureshi, is taxes. “This tax arbitrage is a big part of why MetaPlanet trades at a premium to [net asset value] — buying a corporate shell of BTC is tax-advantaged vs trading BTC directly.” Japan’s crypto ecosystem grows as regulations stabilize Even after the amendments in 2017, crypto regulations tightened after further shocks to the crypto ecosystem. In 2018, the crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked for some $350 million . Later that year, crypto exchanges founded the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory body for the industry that received registration from the FSA. The FSA also formed a study group to enhance crypto exchange security. In 2019, regulators clarified definitions for the crypto industry and required platforms to declare their intent to offer services in Japan and comply with the necessary reporting laws. This clarification and requirements also contained measures that have driven growth. In 2022, new legislation allowed certified institutions to offer fiat-backed stablecoins. The FSA also started classifying some cryptocurrencies as “financial products.” These updates have led to a surge in new products and offerings, and piqued investor interest in digital assets. Combined with a decrease in real wages relative to inflation, Japanese investors are seeking investments with better — albeit riskier — returns. Overall crypto holdings show peaks and valleys that reflect market conditions, yet remain on an uptrend. Growth in crypto-related accounts has been steady. Observers say that there’s still plenty of room for growth. Noriyuki Hirosue, CEO of exchange Bitbank, said the tax rule overhaul “could hugely expand the market.” Watanabe said that, if passed, the tax reform “will be a win for the industry. The government has been speaking with industry leaders of Japan and this is a great outcome of collaborations.” Satoshi Hasuo, representative director and executive officer of exchange Coincheck, said that there are still about three times as many people with trading accounts as cryptocurrency accounts. The next step will be “to think about how we'll win these people over.” Indeed, platforms are beginning to compete for what they see as the burgeoning new wave of retail traders entering Japanese markets. Qureshi said, “Corporates drive a lot of the energy here, which is pretty unique. [...] you see SBI (major Ripple stake), Sony, Sega, Nomura, all moving fast and making big moves.” SBI VC trade is reportedly considering offering higher leverage in its crypto trading services. SBI Holdings also recently established a joint venture with Circle to offer USDC ( USDC ) lending services. And while non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may be essentially dead in most places, Japanese companies are using them to appeal to tourists and cash in on popular IPs like Hello Kitty.

Lord Speaker John McFall told the House of Lords on Tuesday that the Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill has received royal assent, meaning King Charles has formally approved it and it has now become law. Freddie New, policy chief at advocacy group Bitcoin Policy UK, said on X that the bill “becoming law is a massive step forward for Bitcoin in the United Kingdom and for everyone who holds and uses it here.” Source: Freddie New Common law in the UK, based on judges’ decisions, has established that digital assets are property , but the bill sought to codify a recommendation made by the Law Commission of England and Wales in 2024 that crypto be categorized as a new form of personal property for clarity. “UK courts have already treated digital assets as property, but that was all through case-by-case judgments,” said the advocacy group CryptoUK. “Parliament has now written this principle into law.” “This gives digital assets a much clearer legal footing — especially for things like proving ownership, recovering stolen assets, and handling them in insolvency or estate cases,” it added. Digital “things” now considered personal property CryptoUK said that the bill confirms “that digital or electronic ‘things’ can be objects of personal property rights.” UK law categorizes personal property in two ways: a “thing in possession,” which is tangible property such as a car, and and a “thing in action,” intangible property, like the right to enforce a contract. The bill clarifies that “a thing that is digital or electronic in nature” isn’t outside the realm of personal property rights just because it is neither a “thing in possession” nor a “thing in action.” The Law Commission argued in its report in 2024 that digital assets can possess both qualities, and said that their unclear fit into property rights laws could hamstring dispute resolutions in court. Related: Group of EU banks pushes for a euro-pegged stablecoin by 2027 Change gives “greater clarity” to crypto users CryptoUK said on X that the law gives “greater clarity and protection for consumers and investors” and gives crypto holders “the same confidence and certainty they expect with other forms of property.” “Digital assets can be clearly owned, recovered in cases of theft or fraud, and included within insolvency and estate processes,” it added. The group added that the UK now has a “clear legal basis for ownership and transfer” of crypto and the country would now be “better positioned to support the growth of new financial products, tokenised real-world assets, and more secure digital markets.” The country’s finance authority reported late last year that roughly 12% of UK adults own cryptocurrency, up from 10% in its previous findings. The UK also revealed plans for a crypto regulatory regime in April that would bring crypto businesses under similar rules to other finance companies, aiming to make the country a global hub for crypto while promoting consumer protections.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United States’ new approach to stablecoin regulation is reshaping global liquidity flows and driving a sharp structural split with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime, effectively creating separate US and EU stablecoin liquidity pools, according to a new report from blockchain security auditor CertiK. The report finds that the US digital asset market entered a new phase of regulatory clarity in 2025, with federal legislation and administrative reforms now broadly aligned around how digital assets are issued, traded and custodied. At the center of that shift is the GENIUS Act , signed into law by US President Donald Trump in July, which establishes the first federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law imposes strict reserve requirements, bans yield-bearing stablecoins , and formally integrates stablecoin issuers into the US financial system. While the framework provides long-sought regulatory certainty for US issuers, the report warns that it also accelerates global divergence with the EU’s MiCA regime, leaving the US with a “distinct liquidity pool” and effectively fracturing the global stablecoin market. As a result, CertiK expects stablecoin liquidity to become increasingly segmented by jurisdiction, introducing new cross-border settlement frictions and potentially opening the door to regional stablecoin arbitrage.

Source: CertiK Related: Crypto Biz: Corporate stablecoin race heats up with Citi, Western Union at the helm MiCA draws fire over banking risk as US sees stablecoins as statecraft While the European Union’s MiCA regime mirrors the US GENIUS Act in requiring full redemption at par and banning yield on stablecoins, it has drawn criticism for introducing banking concentration risk, as the rules require a majority of issuer reserves to be held inside EU-based banks. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told Cointelegraph that this structure could introduce “systemic risks” for issuers , noting that banks typically lend out a significant share of their deposits under the fractional reserve system. Others, including Anastasija Plotnikova, founder of Fideum, have warned that MiCA’s framework could also accelerate industry consolidation, raising barriers to entry for smaller issuers due to higher compliance and capital costs. Nevertheless, neither the GENIUS Act nor MiCA appears designed to preserve global stablecoin fungibility. Instead, both frameworks prioritize regulatory oversight and financial stability, while, in the case of the United States, explicitly reinforcing dollar liquidity and global dollar usage . That view was reinforced earlier this year by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , who said the administration would take a deliberate approach to stablecoin regulation and use it as a tool to extend US dollar dominance. “As President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that,” Bessent said.

While crypto derivatives long predate ETFs, the space has drawn less attention amid massive inflows into Bitcoin funds . Still, the third quarter marked a period of rapid growth for institutional derivatives activity on CME, with combined futures and options volume reaching a record high of over $900 billion. The quarter ended with a record average daily open interest of $31.3 billion across CME’s futures and options contracts. This is an important signal because open interest reflects the amount of capital that remains actively committed to the market, not just short-term trading turnover. Rising open interest typically points to deeper liquidity and greater institutional conviction. Derivatives activity also broadened beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Ethereum’s native token, with trading in Ether and Micro Ether futures climbing sharply.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED An official from the Bank of Russia suggested easing restrictions on cryptocurrencies in response to the sweeping sanctions imposed on the country. According to a Monday report by local news outlet Kommersant, Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said the regulator is discussing easing regulations for cryptocurrencies. He explicitly linked the rationale for this effort to the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Chistyukhin said that easing the crypto rules is particularly relevant when Russia and Russians are subject to restrictions “on the use of normal currencies for making payments abroad.” Russia banned the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in the summer of 2020. Chistyukhin said he expects Russia’s central bank to reach an agreement with the Ministry of Finance on this issue by the end of this month. The central issue being discussed is the removal of the requirement to meet the “super-qualified investor” criteria for buying and selling crypto with actual delivery.

This limits access to cryptocurrencies for transactions or investment to only the wealthiest few in Russian society. “We are discussing the feasibility of using ‘superquals’ in the new regulation of crypto assets,” Chistyukhin said, in an apparent shifting approach to the restrictive regulation.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki declined to sign a bill imposing strict regulations on the crypto asset market, drawing praise from the crypto community and sharp criticism from others in the government. Nawrocki vetoed Poland’s Crypto-Asset Market Act, saying its provisions “genuinely threaten the freedoms of Poles, their property, and the stability of the state,” according to a statement by the president’s press office on Monday. Introduced in June, the bill has drawn criticism from industry advocates such as Polish politician Tomasz Mentzen, who had anticipated the president’s refusal to sign it as it cleared parliamentary approval. Although crypto advocates welcomed the veto as a win for the market, several government officials condemned the move, claiming the president had “chosen chaos” and must bear full responsibility for the outcome. Why the president vetoed the bill One of the main reasons cited for the veto was a provision allowing authorities to easily block websites operating in the crypto market. “Domain blocking laws are opaque and can lead to abuse,” the president’s office said in an official news release. The president’s office also cited the bill’s widely criticized length, saying its complexity reduces transparency and would lead to “overregulation,” especially when compared with simpler frameworks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.

Critics jump in: “The president chose chaos” Nawrocki’s veto has triggered a strong backlash from top Polish officials, including Finance Minister Andrzej Domański and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski. Domański warned on X that “already now 20% of clients are losing their money as a result of abuses in this market,” accusing the president of having “chosen chaos” and saying he bears full responsibility for the fallout.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Japanese government is reportedly backing plans to introduce a significant reduction in the nation’s maximum tax rate on crypto profits, with a flat rate of 20% across the board. Japan’s financial regulator , the Financial Services Agency (FSA), first floated the proposed tax changes in mid-November, outlining plans to introduce a bill in early 2026, and now the government and ruling coalition — the political parties in control of Japan’s parliament, the National Diet — are on board. According to a report from Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia on Sunday, the new rules aim to align crypto taxation rules with those of other financial products, such as equities and investment funds. Under the current laws, taxation on crypto trading is included as part of income taxes for individuals and businesses, falling under the category of “miscellaneous income.” The rate ranges from 5% on the lower end of the spectrum to 45% on the high end, with high-income earners potentially on the hook for an additional 10% inhabitant tax. Meanwhile, assets such as equities and investment trusts are taxed separately, with a flat 20% tax on profits, regardless of the amount. The tax changes could be a boon for the domestic cryptocurrency market, as the higher tax rates may have deterred potential investors. Source: Sota Watanabe According to the Nikkei report, the potential changes to crypto taxation in Japan will be introduced as part of a “solid investor-protection framework” proposed in the FSA’s bill, which aims to amend the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The FSA will submit the bill during the regular Diet session in 2026, as it pushes for greater oversight of crypto trading, including a ban on dealing with non-public information and stricter investment disclosures. Japan finally set for crypto tax change after long fight The Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), the nation’s major crypto-focused non-governmental lobbying group, has been calling for these changes for almost three years. Related: Bitcoin falls to $84K: Is Japan’s bond market the culprit, or is more at play?

While it is unclear if the JBA had a direct influence on the FSA’s thinking, the financial watchdog did start warming up to the idea and pushing for reform in September 2024.

The transaction, slated to close in the second quarter of 2026, will bring about $28 billion in additional assets under supervision to Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management, which reported $3.45 trillion in assets under supervision (AUS) at the end of the third quarter. Goldman said the purchase will broaden its plans for active and defined-outcome ETFs, a fund that uses options to limit losses and set how much of an asset’s gains investors can capture over a fixed period. Launched in February, Innovator’s QBF ETF uses FLEX options referencing Bitcoin ETFs or the Cboe Bitcoin US ETF Index to mirror part of Bitcoin’s gains while capping quarterly losses at 20%. Its current 71% participation rate means the fund is designed to capture 71% of any positive Bitcoin ( BTC ) price move over that period.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Republican lawmakers on the US House Financial Services Committee and House Oversight Subcommittee released a final report on what they called “debanking of digital assets,” claiming that the previous administration was responsible for cutting off access to financial services for some crypto companies and individuals. In a Monday notice, House Financial Services Chair French Hill and Oversight Subcommittee Chair Dan Meuser claimed that regulators under the administration of former US President Joe Biden “used vague rules, excessive discretion, informal guidance, and aggressive enforcement actions to pressure banks away from serving digital asset clients” — actions many Republicans have referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” The report concluded that legislative action, among other measures, was necessary to provide clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. Hill and Meuser said, “Congress must enact digital asset market structure legislation,” known as the CLARITY Act, and other bills targeting the cryptocurrency industry. “Overall, the CLARITY Act heads off a future Operation Choke Point 3.0 by reversing the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach, enabling market participants to lawfully operate in the US under clear rules of the road, and making clear that banks may engage in the digital asset ecosystem,” said the report. The digital asset market structure bill, which was passed by lawmakers in the House of Representatives in July, is under consideration in the Republican-led Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, both of which have released their versions of draft legislation. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott said in November that the committee planned to have the bill ready for signing into law by early 2026.

Claims of debanking by regulators with the FDIC, Fed, OCC and SEC Many individuals connected to the cryptocurrency industry or who hold digital assets have reported receiving letters from financial institutions saying that they would no longer be allowed to use their services. According to the report, “at least 30 entities and individuals engaging in digital asset-related activities” were debanked in some fashion by US regulators under the Biden administration. Among the measures, the report claimed that regulators enacted to debank crypto companies or individuals included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sending “pause” letters for financial institutions to encourage clients to sever ties to digital assets, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) laying out “additional red tape for digital asset-related activities,” and the Securities and Exchange Commission using “regulation by enforcement tactics” to target crypto companies. Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump’s administration has scaled back or removed regulations impacting the cryptocurrency industry, through executive orders on debanking and with his picks directing activities at the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and SEC.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED South Korean lawmakers are pressing financial regulators to deliver a draft stablecoin bill by a deadline set for later this month, as disagreements over the role of banks continue to stall progress. According to a Monday report by a local news outlet, Maeil Business Newspaper, South Korea’s ruling party sent a “last-minute notice” to financial regulators to submit a stablecoin regulatory framework draft by Dec. 10. Kang Joon-hyun, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, said, “If the government bill does not come over within this deadline, we will take a drive through legislation by the secretary of the political affairs committee.” If it is delivered in time, he expects the bill will be discussed at the extraordinary session of the National Assembly in January 2026. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) later issued a statement saying “no decision had been finalized regarding the formation of a consortium for issuing a KRW-denominated stablecoin.” The regulator confirmed that stablecoin regulation was discussed on Monday during a ruling party–government consultation, and both sides agreed to prepare the government bill as quickly as possible.

The news follows late November reports that South Korea is likely to end the year without a framework for locally issued stablecoins, amid ongoing disputes over the role of banks in stablecoin issuance. The Bank of Korea (BOK) and other financial regulators clashed over the extent of banks’ involvement in issuing Korean won-pegged stablecoins. The central bank expected banks to own at least 51% of any stablecoin issuer seeking regulatory approval in the country, while regulators want a more diverse ecosystem. Related: South Korea ramps up crypto seizures, will target cold wallets Why a majority bank ownership? A BOK official said at the time that banks “are already under regulatory oversight and have extensive experience handling Anti-Money Laundering protocols,” making them a good option for a stablecoin issuer. Sangmin Seo, the chair of the Kaia DLT Foundation, told Cointelegraph in late October that the central bank’s argument for banks leading a rollout “ seems to lack a logical foundation .” He argued that a better solution would be to establish clear rules for issuers instead. He added: “It would be even more valuable if the Bank of Korea could provide guidelines on how these risks can be mitigated and what qualifications are required for an issuer to be regarded as trustworthy.“ This was discussed again during Monday’s meeting, with an official from Kang’s office saying that the ruling party was “looking for a point of contact, considering both the stability of the BOK’s monetary policy and the industrial innovation emphasized by the [FSC]”.

The odds of Hassett filling the seat have spiked to 66% on Polymarket and 74% on Kalshi at the time of writing.

His financial disclosure reveals at least a seven‑figure Coinbase stake and compensation for serving on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council, placing him unusually close to the crypto industry for a potential Fed chair.​ Still, crypto has been burned before by reading too much into “crypto‑literate” resumes. Gary Gensler arrived at the Securities and Exchange Commission with MIT blockchain courses under his belt, but went on to preside over a wave of high‑profile enforcement actions, some of which critics branded as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 .” A Hassett-led Fed might be more open to experimentation and less reflexively hostile to bank‑crypto activity. Still, the institution’s mandate on financial stability means markets should not assume a one‑way bet on deregulation.​ Related: Caitlin Long’s crypto bank loses appeal over Fed master account Supervision pushback inside the Fed The Hassett odds have jumped just as the Fed’s own approach to bank supervision has received pushback from veterans like Fed Governor Michael Barr, who earned his reputation as one of Operation Chokepoint 2.0’s key architects. According to Caitlin Long, while he Barr “was Vice Chairman of Supervision & Regulation he did Warren’s bidding,” and he “has made it clear he will oppose changes made by Trump & his appointees.” On Nov. 18, the Fed released new Supervisory Operating Principles that shift examiners toward a “risk‑first” framework, directing staff to focus on material safety‑and‑soundness risks rather than procedural or documentation issues. In a speech the same day, Barr warned that narrowing oversight, weakening ratings frameworks and making it harder to issue enforcement actions or matters requiring attention could leave supervisors slower to act on emerging risks, arguing that gutting those tools may repeat pre‑crisis mistakes.​ Days later, in Consumer Affairs Letter 25‑1, the Fed clarified that the new Supervisory Operating Principles do not apply to its Consumer Affairs supervision program (an area under Barr’s committee as a governor). If prediction markets are right and a crypto‑friendly Hassett inherits this landscape, his Fed would not be writing on a blank slate but stepping into an institution already mid‑pivot on how hard (and where) it leans on banks.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japanese government bond yields have jumped to their highest level in decades, prompting some analysts to speculate that it could be behind the recent crypto market sell-off on Sunday. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield hit 1.86% on Monday, its highest level since April 2008, according to MarketWatch. Yields in the 10-year bonds have almost doubled in Japan over the past 12 months. Japan’s two-year bond yields also hit 1% for the first time since 2008. While 1.86% is not a substantial yield from government bonds, it is significant because it marks a shift, as Japan has had a very low interest rate environment for decades, with negative or close to zero rates prevailing for the most part, and a very stable bond market. This has encouraged institutional investors around the world to borrow low-interest Japanese yen to buy higher-yielding, riskier assets, in a strategy known as the “ Yen Carry Trade .” “Trillions borrowed in yen, deployed into US Treasurys, European bonds, emerging market debt, risk assets everywhere,” explained economics author Shanaka Anslem Perera, who said, “That anchor is now breaking.” Japan's 10-year bond prices hit their highest level since 2008. Source: MarketWatch Japan’s bond yield hike is bad timing for US Japanese institutions hold approximately $1.1 trillion in US Treasury securities, and is the largest foreign position, explained Perera. “When domestic yields rise from nothing to nearly 2%, the math changes. Capital that flowed outward for decades faces pressure to repatriate.” Related: Bitcoin crashes 5% in ‘Sunday slam’ as liquidations surge The timing couldn’t be worse for the United States, as it comes when the Federal Reserve terminates quantitative tightening, and when the US Treasury requires record issuance to finance $1.8 trillion deficits, he stated. “When the world’s creditor nations stop funding the world’s debtor nations at artificially suppressed rates, the entire post-2008 financial architecture must reprice.” Analysts warn of possible flight to safety ahead This could impact the cryptocurrency market in several ways. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and cryptocurrencies typically thrive in an era of ultra-loose monetary policy and low interest rates globally. When Japan provided an abundance of cheap money through the carry trade, some of that capital flowed into riskier assets, such as crypto and US tech stocks. If that liquidity reverses and flows back to Japan, there will be less speculative capital available for crypto markets. “Crypto is usually the first place where all of this shows up. It sits at the highest end of the risk spectrum, so even small shifts in liquidity lead to sharp moves,” said DeFi market analyst “Wukong.” If global bond markets reprice violently, investors typically flee to safety first, resulting in a sell-off of all risk assets as people scramble for cash and liquidity.

Nasdaq’s head of digital assets, Matt Savarese, spoke to CNBC on Thursday.

It was only in October that Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that tokenization will “eventually eat the whole financial system.” Crypto industry is divided on tokenized equities Savarese emphasized that Nasdaq is aiming to be an innovator in the ecosystem, noting that the exchange was the first to transition markets from paper-based trading to electronic systems.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED South Korea is preparing one of its toughest Anti-Money Laundering (AML) crackdowns as it plans to expand its crypto Travel Rule to cover transactions under 1 million won ($680). According to a Yonhap News report, the chairman of the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), Lee Eok-won, revealed the plans to the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, saying that the government will crack down on money laundering activities that exploit crypto transactions. “We will crack down on crypto money laundering […] expanding the Travel Rule to transactions under 1 million won,” he said, according to a translated version of his comments. The move closes a gap that allowed users to break transfers into smaller pieces to avoid identity reporting mandates. With the planned change, exchanges will be required to collect and share the sender and receiver for crypto transfers under $680. Combating drug trafficking, tax evasion and overseas schemes The FSC said the new rules aim to stop the increasing use of crypto rails for tax evasion, drug trafficking and other overseas payment schemes. The expanded rule will be implemented along with new restrictions targeting “high-risk” offshore exchanges. According to the regulator, these are platforms that pose a heightened risk of money laundering and will be blocked from interacting with South Koreans. Exchanges will also undergo more stringent reviews of their financial health, widening the criteria for virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration. Additionally, the government will prohibit individuals with criminal records involving drugs or tax crimes from becoming major shareholders of VASPs. This aims to prevent malicious actors from holding influential positions at licensed firms. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will introduce pre-emptive account freezing mechanisms for serious offenses to stop funds from disappearing during investigations. Officials plan to finalize the new framework in the first half of 2026 and submit legislative amendments to the National Assembly, while expanding their collaboration with global bodies, such as the Financial Action Task Force. The forthcoming changes represent the country’s most comprehensive move to tighten AML regulations since the Special Financial Information Act was updated in 2021.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The UK has floated a new tax framework that eases the burden on decentralized finance (DeFi) users, with deferred capital gains taxes on crypto lending and liquidity pool users until the underlying token is sold, which the local industry has welcomed. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) proposed on Wednesday a “no gain, no loss” approach to DeFi that would cover lending out a token and receiving the same type back, borrowing arrangements and moving tokens into a liquidity pool. Taxable gains or losses would be calculated when liquidity tokens are redeemed, based on the number of tokens a user receives back compared to the number they originally contributed, according to the proposal. Currently, when a user deposits funds into a protocol, regardless of the reason, the move may be subject to capital gains tax. In the UK, capital gains tax rates can vary between 18% and 32%, depending on the action. Tax framework a ‘positive signal’ for UK crypto regulation Sian Morton, marketing lead at the crosschain payments system Relay protocol, said HMRC’s no gain, no loss approach is a “meaningful step forward for UK DeFi users who borrow stablecoins against their crypto collateral, and moves tax treatment closer to the actual economic reality of these interactions.” “A positive signal for the UK’s evolving stance on crypto regulation,” she added. Maria Riivari, a lawyer at the DeFi platform Aave, said the change “would bring clarity that DeFi transactions do not trigger tax until you truly sell your tokens.” “Other countries facing similar questions may want to take note of HMRC’s approach and the depth of research and consideration behind it,” she added.

In a Thursday announcement , Ripple said the approval allows regulated firms to deploy Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) inside the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) financial zone,  an international financial center and free zone located on Al Maryah and Al Reem Islands in Abu Dhabi. “With a market capitalization of over $1 billion and growing adoption in core financial uses like collateral and payments, RLUSD is quickly becoming a go-to USD stablecoin for major institutions,” said Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple. The green light came from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which oversees activity in the ADGM. Under the decision, companies licensed by the regulator can use RLUSD for permitted activities, provided they meet compliance requirements tied to fiat-referenced tokens, including reserve management and disclosure obligations.

In March, the company confirmed it had received full regulatory approval , allowing it to offer cross-border crypto payment services inside the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a major free economic zone with its own regulatory framework. In June, the DFSA approved RLUSD for use by companies operating inside the DIFC, allowing the stablecoin to be used for regulated activities such as payments and treasury management.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Australia’s government has introduced a new bill that will regulate crypto platforms under existing financial services laws after an industry consultation saw cautious support for the legislation. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino introduced the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025 on Wednesday, which would require crypto companies such as exchanges and custody providers to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL). “Across the world, digital assets are reshaping finance,” Mulino told the House on Wednesday. “Australia must keep pace. If we get this right, we can attract investment, create jobs and position our financial system as a leader in innovation.” Daniel Mulino introducing the bill to the House on Wednesday. Source: YouTube The Treasury launched a consultation over a draft of the bill in September, which Mulino told crypto conferencegoers was “the cornerstone” of the Albanese Government’s crypto roadmap released in March . The local crypto industry largely supported the draft legislation, but many told the consultation that the bill needed further clarity and simplification. New bill to include safeguards for crypto held for clients Mulino told the House it’s currently possible for a company to hold an unlimited amount of client crypto “without any financial law safeguards,” adding the risks of scams or frauds like FTX “cannot be ignored.” “This bill responds to those challenges by reducing loopholes and ensuring comparable activities face comparable obligations, tailored to the digital asset ecosystem,” he said. Currently, crypto platforms that simply facilitate trading only need to register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, which has 400 registered crypto exchanges , many of which are inactive. The legislation would focus on the companies that hold crypto for customers, “rather than the underlying technology itself,” Mulino added. “This means it can evolve as new forms of tokenisation and digital services emerge.” Crypto bill adds two new license types, exempts small players The bill amends the Corporations Act to create two new financial products, a “digital asset platform” and a “tokenized custody platform,” both of which will need an AFSL. The license will register the platforms with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Currently, only exchanges that sell “financial products,” such as derivatives, must register. Mulino said anyone “advising on, dealing in, or arranging for others to deal in” crypto will be treated as providing a financial service that requires a license. Related: Australia risks ‘missed opportunity’ by shirking tokenization: Top regulator Under the bill, crypto and custody platforms must meet ASIC’s minimum standards for transactions, settlements and holding customer assets. They must also give a guide to clients explaining their service, fees and risks. Mulino said the bill exempts “small-scale” companies from licensing, those with less than 10 million Australian dollars ($6.5 million) in transaction volume in 12 months, along with those that deal or advise on platforms “incidental to their main, non-financial activities.” The bill outlines an 18-month grace period on licensing, which Mulino said gives “relief for businesses trying to do the right thing.” The bill is likely to quickly pass the House, where Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party holds a 94-seat majority. It will then head to the Senate, where Labor may need the support of the crossbench and opposition to pass it.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission shouldn’t grant broad regulatory relief to crypto companies launching tokenized stock offerings, a stock exchange advocacy group has argued. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) said in a Nov. 21 letter to the SEC  that it was “alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenized US stocks.” “These products are marketed as stock tokens or the equivalent to stocks when they are not,” the group said. “This development poses multiple and interconnected risks.” Multiple crypto exchanges are seeking to offer tokenized stocks in the US, allowing investors to buy exposure to public companies without owning shares. They’re touted as having faster settlements compared to stock exchanges and can be traded at any time, not just during market hours. Crypto companies that aren’t SEC-registered broker-dealers would have to get an exemption from the agency, and its chair, Paul Atkins, has floated granting one . Tokenized stock exemption relief must be “targeted,” group says The WFE, which counts Cboe and the Nasdaq as members, said it supports the SEC using exemptive relief, but it is “concerned that the broad use of such relief presents risks to investors and market integrity.” “We simply believe that this authority is most effective when exercised in a targeted manner and not applied as a means to circumvent or fast-track exemptions to longstanding regulatory requirements,” it added. Paul Atkins addressing an SEC Crypto Task Force roundtable on tokenization in May. Source: YouTube The WFE said tokenization “is likely a natural evolution in capital markets” and that it was “pro-innovation,” but that it “must be done in a responsible way that does not put investors or market integrity at risk.” The group said it would be better for the SEC to make a public rule filing to garner feedback rather than to “seek to make large-scale changes with exemptive relief.” “Alternatively, the Commission could consider the creation of a sandbox regime or other innovation facilitator,” it added. In August, the WFE urged the SEC, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the International Organization of Securities Commissions for stricter oversight of tokenized stocks, arguing they lacked investor protections. SEC weighs exemptions for tokenized stocks Atkins, a former crypto lobbyist, has said he’s considering an “innovation exemption” to relieve crypto firms from certain regulations, thereby speeding up the process of bringing crypto and blockchain products to market.

US trading platforms have begun lining up to offer tokenized stocks under the crypto-friendly SEC. Robinhood Markets began offering hundreds of tokenized stocks to European investors in June, with the intention of bringing the same products to the US, following a similar offer by Kraken a month earlier. Coinbase also reportedly sought SEC approval in June to offer tokenized stocks , with its legal chief, Paul Grewal, saying it was a “huge priority” for the crypto exchange.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Tokenized money market funds are emerging as one of the most important yield-bearing assets on public blockchains, offering money-market returns and securities-level protections that stablecoins can’t provide, according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the bulletin , tokenized money market funds now hold nearly $9 billion in assets, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. The BIS warned that as these tokenized Treasury portfolios become a key source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem, they also bring new operational and liquidity risks. Tokenized money market funds are blockchain-based representations of traditional money market portfolios, providing investors with onchain access to short-term, interest-bearing assets, such as US Treasurys. The BIS noted that while these tokens offer the flexibility of stablecoins, they depend on permissioned wallets, offchain market plumbing and a small set of large holders; factors that could accelerate stress if redemptions spike or onchain liquidity thins out. Although the tokens move on public blockchains, the underlying portfolios, pricing and settlement still occur in traditional markets. BIS says that gap creates a structural mismatch: token transfers settle instantly, while the assets behind them do not. During periods of heavy withdrawals, this gap may make it more challenging for funds to meet redemptions without contributing to further volatility. Interlinkages with stablecoins create additional risk, as some tokenized money market funds also enable rapid conversions into stablecoins or are used for leveraged trades. The BIS warns that these feedback loops could allow market stress to spread much faster than in traditional money market funds. The analysis was released just a day after the institution appointed International Monetary Fund chief and CBDC backer Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli as the next head of its Innovation Hub .

Listen 0:00 How to COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways For years, US crypto firms operated under overlapping rules from the SEC, CFTC, FTC and FinCEN. The revised 2025 plan signals Washington’s intent to build a more flexible and structured framework tailored to digital assets. The SEC is moving toward a model centered on innovation, capital formation, market efficiency and investor protection. This marks an acknowledgment that crypto requires dedicated rules rather than adaptations of older regulations. The plan may lead to exemptions, safe harbors, DLT-specific transfer agent rules and crypto market structure amendments. These steps could help integrate digital assets into traditional market infrastructure. The plan’s success will depend on cross-agency coordination and international alignment between regulatory agencies. Strong execution could encourage other jurisdictions to adopt more consistent global standards for crypto. Since its early years, the US cryptocurrency industry has operated in an unclear regulatory environment. Different agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have been overlooking different aspects of the crypto ecosystem. In this scenario, crypto enterprises found it difficult to determine what was allowed and what was not. The SEC’s revised 2025 plan is likely to usher in positive change. It suggests that Washington, DC is seeking a more flexible regulatory framework that streamlines crypto oversight while supporting innovation. This article discusses the possible outcomes of the plan, its key points, the advantages it may bring and the risks it could involve. It also explores how the plan may influence the crypto ecosystem worldwide. Why the SEC’s revised 2025 plan matters Cryptocurrency has evolved well beyond its early speculative phase. Digital tokens are now traded on major platforms, institutional investors allocate funds to them, and tokenization is gradually entering traditional finance. In a fast-changing crypto landscape, regulations are always trying to catch up. The SEC’s new agenda reflects a shift in approach. It emphasizes innovation, capital management, market efficiency and investor protection. This shows the SEC’s acknowledgment that cryptocurrencies require tailored rules rather than adaptations of existing ones. Industry representatives have highlighted the lack of clear compliance guidelines and the conflicting interpretations of existing rules. They also point out the tendency to prioritize enforcement over guidance. The SEC’s 2025 agenda includes initiatives that align with many industry concerns. Did you know? After the Mt. Gox exchange collapse in 2014, Japan became the first major economy to pass a dedicated crypto law in 2017. Japan officially recognized Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a legal payment method and encouraged exchanges to adopt bank-level security standards. Major elements of the SEC’s 2025 plan This comprehensive agenda outlines the key areas and initiatives the SEC will pursue to safeguard investors: New rules for issuing and selling digital assets The SEC intends to establish clear guidelines for the issuance of digital assets , which may include exemptions or safe harbor provisions for token projects. This would help determine when a token is considered a security, when it is not and what information issuers must provide. For startups, such clarity would reduce the uncertainty that surrounds token launches. Permission for crypto trading on national securities exchanges The SEC is considering changes that would allow digital assets to be traded directly on registered national exchanges and alternative trading systems. These potential amendments aim to bring crypto assets closer to the regulated infrastructure used for traditional stocks, improve surveillance, strengthen investor protections and reduce reliance on less regulated offshore platforms. Simplified disclosure requirements The plan aims to streamline and modernize disclosure and compliance obligations for publicly listed companies, including those involved with digital assets. This would reduce administrative burdens for both cryptocurrency-focused firms and traditional businesses and encourage broader adoption. Clearer rules for crypto intermediaries Broker-dealers, custodians and trading platforms have operated under uncertain regulatory requirements. The new agenda seeks to clarify how existing rules for securities intermediaries apply to cryptocurrency activities. This would allow more financial institutions, banks and fintech companies to offer crypto-related services with greater confidence. Streamlining disclosures and reducing compliance burden The SEC intends to propose a framework for streamlining disclosures. The agency’s primary role involves establishing disclosure standards designed to enhance clarity and mitigate investor risk. With the revised plan, the agency aims to reduce the compliance burden for public companies, particularly regarding shareholder proposals. The following table provides a brief overview of the SEC’s revised 2025 plan: Salient points of the SEC revised 2025 plan Benefits of the SEC’s revised 2025 plan The SEC’s 2025 plan aims to enhance protection for individual investors, promote fair competition for issuers and financial institutions and strengthen the integrity and efficiency of the capital markets. For cryptocurrency startups: Clearer regulations could lower legal risks and speed up product development. They would allow companies to stay in the US and grow rather than relocate abroad. For traditional financial institutions: Banks and asset managers would gain regulated pathways to participate in digital assets while remaining fully compliant. For investors (retail and institutional): Investors would benefit from better disclosures, safer trading venues and more consistent oversight of platforms. The plan could reduce risks such as hidden leverage or manipulative trading practices. For regulators and markets: A more unified approach would reduce overlap between agencies. It would enhance market surveillance and align cryptocurrency regulation with established financial safeguards. Did you know? Swiss regulators classify tokens based on their economic function as payment, utility or asset, similar to how farmers classify livestock. This approach helped Switzerland become one of the earliest global hubs for token innovation. Remaining questions, risks and potential global impact While the SEC’s revised 2025 plan looks promising, its success depends on several factors. For instance, it remains to be seen whether US agencies can coordinate effectively with regulators in other countries, given the global nature of cryptocurrencies. The SEC will need to find an appropriate balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. This balance will determine whether the 2025 agenda becomes successful or remains a statement of intent. If the plan does not deliver tangible results, market participants will continue to face uncertainty. The US may lose innovation to other countries and risk its leadership in digital asset finance. When the US updates its regulatory framework, other jurisdictions take notice. Clearer rules in the US will encourage similar regulatory changes in the European Union, the UK and Asia and foster international cooperation. This will lead to more consistent global standards for stablecoins, tokenization and custody. The SEC’s 2025 regulatory agenda marks a significant shift toward replacing uncertainty with structure. If the proposed measures succeed, the US may enter a new phase in which cryptocurrency regulation supports responsible development and the protection of investors.

Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, has reportedly emerged as a leader among the Trump administration’s short list to replace Jerome Powell. Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED US President Donald Trump is slated to choose a new Federal Reserve chair by Christmas, and the frontrunner, Kevin Hassett, could be a boon for the crypto industry. Hassett is a White House economic adviser who has reportedly emerged as a strong candidate for the Fed chair position. He is the director of the National Economic Council and oversaw the digital asset working group directed by the White House earlier this year. Trump has been trying to increase his administration’s control over the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, thereby expanding the White House’s influence over monetary policy. The nomination process has not yet begun, but observers are already speculating about what a Hassett chairmanship could mean for US monetary policy and crypto. Hassett’s official portrait. Source: Executive Office of the President of the United States Fed frontrunner Kevin Hassett has supported crypto in the past Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at the Columbia Business School in the 1990s. While there, he also served as an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was also a policy consultant with the Department of the Treasury under the administrations of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Hassett briefly sat on the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the first Trump administration. During the president’s second term, Hassett served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC), a part of the executive branch that the president uses for setting domestic and international economic policy. Despite a lack of clear public statements, Hassett is widely regarded as pro-crypto. In June, he revealed a stake of at least $1 million in Coinbase and that he was compensated at least $50,001 for his role on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. The NEC, where he serves as director, oversaw the development of the White House’s digital asset working group, which published a paper earlier this year outlining the administration’s policy on crypto. The Fed doesn’t oversee securities or commodities, so its policy changes can’t affect crypto regulation. But a crypto-friendly Fed could still have a positive impact on the industry in several ways. Related: Bitcoiners perk up as odds of a December Fed rate cut almost double Firstly, lower interest rates generally mean better crypto prices. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that the implications for markets are “strongly bullish.” He called Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts.” Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset investment platform Grayscale, said , “On the margin Hassett should be considered positive for crypto => supports rate cuts, past Coinbase advisor, NEC director during White House crypto policy push.” The Fed also regulates banks, namely bank holding companies, payment system access, reserve requirements and liquidity and risk rules. Tightening or loosening these rules could affect crypto companies’ access to a number of services, including: Crypto custody Lending against crypto collateral Access to payment rails Stablecoin issuer requirements vis-à-vis banking regulations Settlement rules. Still, the White House has yet to make a clear nomination. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced in late October that Hassett was on a short list of five nominees to replace Jerome Powell. These included former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. A nomination is expected by Christmas. Trump administration threatens an independent Fed Trump has been attempting to assert more control over the Federal Reserve as a means to exert greater influence over his preferred monetary policies. Earlier this year, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Her refusal to step down sent the case to the Supreme Court, which, for the time being, has allowed her to stay on. In a court filing, Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the attempt a “broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System.” Trump attempted to have Cook removed through the courts. Source: James Burnham The Council of Foreign Relations has lauded the independence of this system, stating that it “shields the Federal Reserve from undue political influence, such as pressure from the White House to lower interest rates ahead of an election, which could offer short-term political gains but cause long-term economic harm.” An independent Fed also “enhances the Fed’s credibility” and makes the market more confident in its decisions. “Crucially, it also empowers the Federal Reserve to take difficult but necessary actions, even when they are unpopular.” John Authers, a senior editor for markets and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote that choosing Hassett “appears to be about loyalty.” “Trump regards nominating Jerome Powell eight years ago as a big mistake. Waller, Warsh and Rieder all in different ways might establish themselves as independent from the administration.” George Pollack, a senior US policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, reportedly said that Trump will nominate Hassett “because of his confidence that Hassett will be the candidate most likely to support the administration’s priorities.” Were the Fed to become another arm of the administration, the results could be good for crypto markets in the short term but disastrous elsewhere. Lower-than-needed interest rates could score cheap political points but lead to increased inflation. The Center for American Progress explained , “Knowing that the rates will be based on well-researched data, and not political whims, assures the world that the U.S. economy will remain relatively stable and its markets will remain rational.” Magazine: Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain # Federal Reserve # Politics # United States # Donald Trump # Regulation # Features Add reaction","Aaron Wood Nov 26, 2025 Who’s Kevin Hassett, Trump’s reported crypto-friendly pick for the Fed?

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Blockrise, a Netherlands-based Bitcoin-only startup, has secured a regulatory license that opens the door for fully regulated Bitcoin financial services across Europe. The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) has granted Blockrise a license under the new Europe-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, the company announced Wednesday. Issued on Tuesday, the MiCA license allows Blockrise to provide its Bitcoin ( BTC ) services, including custody solutions, trading and asset management, throughout Europe. Additionally, Blockrise is debuting a new service that allows its business clients to obtain Bitcoin loans, even though MiCA does not yet regulate cryptocurrency lending services. Business loans starting at $23,000 “MiCA is the basis for Blockrise to provide Bitcoin-backed loans, only provisioning to business clients in order to stay within the regulatory constraints,” Blockrise CEO Jos Lazet told Cointelegraph. Starting today, Blockrise will offer a new credit service to all its corporate clients, with business loans starting at 20,000 euros ($23,150). “Borrowers can collateralize their Bitcoin and open a loan against it,” Lazet said, adding that the current interest rate is 8%, but is revisited every month.

Source: Blockrise Implemented in full in late 2024, MiCA regulates crypto issuance and trading, though it doesn’t cover many industry services and areas such as lending, decentralized finance (DeFi) and more. Addressing MiCA’s regulatory scope, the Blockrise CEO expressed optimism about the framework’s potential to scale in the coming years. Related: Bitcoin-only app Relai gets EU green light under MiCA “MiCA doesn’t regulate everything yet, however, it is expected to extend over time and include more scopes, such as lending, mining, payments, etc,” Lazet said, adding: “MiCA is a requirement in order to provide Bitcoin-backed loans, such as the MiCA licenses to custody, transfer and broker.” Founded in 2017, Blockrise operates a crypto asset management company that offers a “semi-custodial wallet structure.” Unlike with pure self-custody , where users can recover their assets using a private key , Blockrise clients have a digital Blockrise key, which has no value other than accessing BTC on the platform, according to the CEO. “Blockrise has multiple vaults, so-called Hardware security modules, which securely generate Bitcoin wallets, and the keys cannot be extracted out of the vault. To make a transaction, the user’s Blockrise key is needed,” Lazet said, adding that there’s a dependency on both the user and Blockrise to sign for transactions. Because Blockrise does not directly custody user funds in the traditional sense, Lazet said assets under management are “a tough measurement.” The company currently oversees about 100 million euros ($116 million) in client assets, he said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Stablecoin issuer Tether holds 116 tons of physical gold, placing it on par with central banks such as those in South Korea, Hungary and Greece. Tether is “the largest holder of gold outside central banks,” Jefferies wrote in a recent analysis, per a report by the Financial Times. The investment bank added that Tether’s growing appetite for gold may be playing a larger role in the metal’s recent surge than previously assumed. According to Jefferies, Tether’s gold purchases last quarter accounted for nearly 2% of total global gold demand and almost 12% of central bank purchases. The company said that Tether’s aggressive accumulation over the past two months “is likely to have tightened supply in the short term and influenced sentiment,” potentially driving speculative inflows into gold markets. Investors cited by Jefferies said Tether aims to acquire another 100 tons of gold in 2025. With the company reportedly on track for $15 billion in profit this year, the target appears well within reach, according to the report.

In September, the FT reported that Tether is exploring investments across the gold supply chain, including mining, refining, trading and royalty companies, as part of a broader push to diversify its reserves. Tether also issues Tether Gold (XAUt), its gold-backed token launched in 2020 and advertised as being supported by bullion stored in a Swiss vault. Blockchain data shows XAUt issuance has doubled over the past six months, with Tether adding 275,000 ounces (about $1.1 billion) since August. Tether Gold has a market cap of $2.1 billion.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved regulatory technology (RegTech) company Eunice to run experiments in its sandbox, which offers one of the clearest indications yet of how the country intends to build its forthcoming crypto rulebook. On Wednesday, the FCA announced that Eunice will test a set of standardized crypto disclosure templates with major exchanges, including Coinbase, Crypto.com and Kraken. The company will test whether the templates improve transparency when used in real-world settings. The FCA also highlighted that its regulatory sandbox is still accepting applications from companies looking to test their ideas. “We encourage any firm to apply who are looking to test a similar solution to help inform our regulatory approach to cryptoassets,” said Colin Payne, the head of innovation at the FCA. By testing industry-led tools rather than relying on theoretical policy, the FCA signals that future crypto rules will be shaped through practical trials and real-world feedback. Cointelegraph reached out to Eunice for comments, but had not received a response by publication. UK aims to raise transparency standards in crypto Eunice co-founder and CEO Yi Luo said the sandbox provides a space where regulators and industry members can work together to strengthen the foundations of the UK's crypto markets. She said the project aims to bring more integrity and transparency to crypto at a time when institutional participation is growing. “Leading the work around disclosures is a great point of pride for Eunice, which was founded to bring integrity and transparency to digital assets at a time when institutions are stepping into the space,” she said. Luo told Cointelegraph that the company’s work in the sandbox is aimed at fixing a fundamental weakness in today’s crypto markets, which is the lack of clear, comparable and consistent disclosures. “Today’s disclosures are inconsistent, hard to compare, and often buried in dense text that obscures the fundamentals: what a token is, how value moves, and where the risks lie,” she told Cointelegraph. Luo added that, despite crypto’s rapid evolution, regulators and industry members are converging on core principles for transparency. According to Luo, the FCA’s sandbox reflects that approach by allowing industry to interpret and apply regulatory principles in ways that match real-world technology and market constraints. The pilot also ties directly to the FCA’s broader policy agenda. According to the regulator, the disclosure templates were created in response to last year’s Admissions and Disclosures Discussion Paper, which encouraged the industry to contribute technical expertise and shape early thinking on future rules.

More recently, the UK regulator made moves that signal a more supportive approach to crypto. On Aug. 1, the FCA lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors. This allowed consumers in the UK to engage with crypto-based ETN products. On Sept. 17, the FCA opened a consultation on whether a traditional finance rule like Consumer Duty, which requires companies to deliver good consumer outcomes, should apply to crypto.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has appointed Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, one of the world’s most influential economists on digital money, as the next head of the BIS Innovation Hub, effective March 2026. The BIS said Tuesday that Mancini-Griffoli will “lead work to explore technological solutions within the central bank community on innovation.” His mandate is expected to include ongoing work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized assets and new forms of market infrastructure. Mancini-Griffoli currently serves as the assistant director in the International Monetary Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, where he leads work on payments and currencies. He’s one of the IMF’s most prominent voices advocating for regulated and publicly backed digital money models and has previously warned about the risks of unregulated stablecoins. The appointment comes as the BIS Innovation Hub ramps up major projects, expanding its influence across its global centers. The Hub has become a venue for testing blockchain-inspired settlement systems and digital currency prototypes. For the crypto space, the move signals that the BIS may steer digital asset innovation toward regulated tokenized money, a direction that could shape how central banks assess private blockchain infrastructure and stablecoins. Incoming innovation chief championed synthetic CBDCs Mancini-Griffoli, who has been the IMF’s representative to global policy forums on CBDCs and payments, frequently argued that the most stable path forward lies in hybrid or public-backed arrangements rather than fully private tokens. In 2020, Mancini-Griffoli stated that a synthetic private-public partnership CBDC could empower the private sector , such as blockchain-backed stablecoins, to innovate. He championed the concept of synthetic CBDCs, a model in which private institutions issue digital money fully backed by central bank reserves , essentially blending public-sector safety with private-sector innovation. He also supported tokenized financial instruments, but only when they operate within a public-money architecture that guarantees systemic stability and settlement finality. In September, Mancini-Griffoli argued through an essay that stablecoins carry structural risks if not backed by safe assets and strong governance. He warned that poorly regulated issuers could expose users to runs, liquidity mismatches and loss of value.

Bratcher said that the Texas government will eventually “self-custody Bitcoin,” but as it’s still finalizing the process, the initial $5 million “allocation was made with BlackRock's IBIT ETF.” “$10M is allocated from general revenue but not all $10M has been allocated,” he added. Source: Lee Bratcher Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, said Texas’s move signaled a significant shift in attitude toward Bitcoin in just a short amount of time: “In five years we went from ‘governments will ban bitcoin’ to ‘governments are only buying a small amount of bitcoin’. Hyperbitcoinization has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen.” It is unclear if this move is directly related to the state’s plan for a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. In June, Governor Gregg Abbot officially authorized the creation of a state-managed fund to hold BTC as part of the state’s long-term financial assets, utilizing public funds to build the treasury. As outlined in the initial bill greenlit by Abbot, only assets with a market cap over $500 billion are eligible for inclusion in the reserve, a threshold met by Bitcoin but not by BlackRock’s IBIT . However, the move still signals a step forward in Texas’s BTC adoption plans. While its Bitcoin plans are progressing, Texas may not just stop at digital gold. In mid-October, Texas state Senator Charles Schwertner, one of the lawmakers behind the state’s strategic Bitcoin reserve bill, told Cointelegraph that Ether ( ETH ) may be next, if its market cap can get and stay above $500 billion. “If Ethereum maintains its market cap over 24 months, I think it’s reasonable and prudent to give direction that Ethereum could be added to the cryptocurrency [reserve],” he said. Wisconsin bought $100 million of BlackRock’s BTC ETF in 2024 While some have claimed Texas is the first state to snap up BTC through IBIT, the state of Wisconsin’s investment board actually oversaw the purchase of almost $100 million worth of IBIT shares in May last year, filings show.

More wild stuff for a not-yet-even-two-years-old fund.” IBIT is down around 10% year-to-date, despite the growing embrace of Bitcoin by the US government under the Trump Administration this year. At the time of writing, IBIT is sitting at $49.56, and is up a mere 0.22% in after-hours trading.

Listen 0:00 How to COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: The SEC introduced new post-shutdown guidelines that explain how registration statements, including crypto ETF filings, progress through Sections 8(a) and 461 of the Securities Act. Generic listing standards approved in September 2025 removed the need for individual 19(b) approvals for qualifying crypto ETPs. The government shutdown created a backlog of more than 900 filings, pushing issuers to rely on the automatic 20-day effectiveness mechanism under Section 8(a). The new SEC instructions allow issuers to choose between automatic effectiveness or requesting accelerated effectiveness under Rule 461 for faster launches. After years of slow progress and periodic regulatory pauses, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has released new guidelines that may speed up the approval timeline for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . These updates follow an extended, record-long government shutdown that halted progress on more than 900 pending registration filings across financial markets. As federal operations resumed, the SEC issued technical guidance outlining how issuers can advance ETF applications under Sections 8(a) and 461 of the Securities Act of 1933. This article explains what changed, why it matters and how the updated procedures could shorten timelines for new crypto ETF launches in the US. The regulatory freeze: A look back For most of 2025, ETF issuers, especially those focused on crypto, were already dealing with a heavy procedural load. Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ether ETFs in May 2024, the filing activity has surged, coming from firms seeking to list products tracking altcoins such as Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and others. The regulatory process for many of these products still required individualized review under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This meant issuers depended on the SEC to publish proposed rule changes, open public comment periods and issue approval or denial orders. Timelines varied widely. Pathway to generic listing standards On Sep. 17, 2025, the SEC approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares on Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange BZX Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange Arca. This changed the regulatory process by removing the need for individual Section 19(b) rule change approvals for every qualifying crypto ETF . The new standards were announced alongside the approval of the first multi-crypto asset ETF , the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which holds Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and other coins. This streamlining removed the years-long bottleneck that had previously stalled products, but the immediate push to launch was halted by the government shutdown. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan's X post The shutdown backlog During the 43-day shutdown, more than 900 filings were submitted but could not be processed. ETF issuers were left with no review mechanisms, no staff communication and no way to advance pending filings. In this environment of regulatory paralysis, the only path forward for some issuers was to use an existing mechanism: the automatic 20-day effectiveness provision under Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. This allowed registration statements filed without a delay-in-time clause to automatically become effective after 20 days if the SEC did not take action or object. This mechanism was helpful for the launch of several funds, including Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF . The crisis and the reliance on a technical workaround highlighted the need for a more efficient and formal review process. This approach was referenced directly in the SEC guidance published after operations resumed. Once the SEC reopened, staff was instructed to resume work promptly and orderly. Issuers immediately requested clarity on how filings submitted during the shutdown would be sequenced or amended. What the SEC’s new guidelines actually change On Nov. 13, 2025, the SEC published a detailed set of technical clarifications explaining how it would process the shutdown-period backlog . The SEC’s new guidance was applied to issuers such as Bitwise, which had an XRP ETF filing pending but had not yet completed the Section 8(a) process. The post-shutdown guidance created two primary mechanisms to move stalled applications toward launch. Automatic 20-day effectiveness As a remedy for filings submitted during the shutdown, the guidance confirmed that registration statements filed without a deferral would gain automatic effectiveness after 20 days under Section 8(a). The SEC also clarified that staff would not recommend enforcement action even if the filing does not include Rule 430A information. Request for acceleration via amendment For issuers who want a faster approval timeline or who want to restore active regulatory oversight, the SEC guidance clarified that it may add an amendment deferral and then formally request acceleration under Rule 461. This allows issuers to move beyond the automatic 20-day countdown and seek accelerated effectiveness. The SEC also noted that the division would review filings in the order in which they were received. Did you know? The generic listing standards apply only to exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold an underlying commodity, such as digital assets, that trades on an ISG-member exchange or is subject to a regulated futures market with appropriate surveillance sharing. What this means for crypto ETF issuers moving forward The SEC’s guidance does not guarantee faster approval for every crypto ETF. Substantive legal review remains unchanged. What has changed is the friction in the process. The automatic-effectiveness mechanism under Section 8(a) now plays a larger role because filings submitted without a delay clause during the shutdown can become effective after the standard 20-day period unless the SEC intervenes. Rule 461 allows an issuer to request that the SEC accelerate the effective date of its registration statement to a specific time. To do this, an issuer must first amend its filing to return it to the standard delayed status and then submit a formal Rule 461 request to the SEC. This request is not a mere formality. It serves as confirmation that the issuer, underwriters and advisers are fully aware of, and accept, their legal and antifraud liabilities under the Securities Act. By combining a Rule 461 acceleration request with the new generic listing standards, which bypass the older Section 19(b) delays, issuers have streamlined the entire process. This combination makes the path for compliant altcoin ETPs quicker and more predictable, allowing managers to target specific launch windows with greater certainty. Why speed doesn’t mean safety While the SEC has accelerated the timing of approvals, it has also emphasized that core investor protection rules have not been relaxed. The primary takeaway for issuers is that fast approval does not reduce their legal responsibility. The SEC’s post-shutdown guidance clarifies that the liability and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws still apply to all registration statements, including those that become effective automatically under Section 8(a). This is backed by the core of the Securities Act of 1933: Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2). These rules impose strict liability under Section 11 and a heightened liability standard under Section 12(a)(2) for any material false statements or omissions in the registration documents. In simple terms, if the prospectus is misleading, the issuer is liable, and investors do not have to prove that the company acted carelessly or intentionally. The burden of ensuring accuracy remains with ETF providers, who must conduct thorough internal checks and due diligence to meet this high standard, especially when timelines are compressed. # Regulation Add reaction","Liza Savenko Nov 25, 2025 Why the SEC’s new guidelines could speed up the approval process for new crypto ETFs New SEC rules could reshape the crypto ETF landscape by speeding up approvals, reducing the shutdown backlog and giving issuers a clearer and faster path to market.",CoinTelegraph,2025-11-25 17:54:13+00:00,2025-12-07 11:13:38.601898,2025-12-07T19:16:32.620255

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Nov. 26, 2025, at 8:30 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares and Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody. Major bank Standard Chartered announced fund manager 21Shares has selected it as its digital asset custodian, potentially moving away from a crypto-native partner. According to a Monday announcement from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph, the bank will provide crypto custody services to 21Shares, which offers multiple exchange-traded crypto products. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank’s global head of financing and securities services, said the collaboration allows them to “to extend our expertise into the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem.” However, 21Shares already had a crypto-native custody partner. In late June 2024, the fund manager partnered with crypto-native custodian Zodia Custody to hold its assets. Zodia Custody was co-founded by Standard Chartered in 2020 and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, indicating that the bank wanted to avoid direct involvement in crypto at the time. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, said that the company views Standard Chartered’s appointment “as a positive sign of the industry’s continued maturity.” He also explained that “Standard Chartered’s custody offering employs Zodia Custody’s underlying technology and risk frameworks.” The move comes as more traditional financial institutions roll out crypto services, often with reputational advantages over crypto-native competitors. Still, Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that this is not a shift from existing partners. Instead, “adding Standard Chartered simply expands our multi-custodian model.” He said: “Bringing in a global bank complements our crypto-native partners and increases flexibility for our clients.“ Byas-Perry also said that “21Shares continues to work with leading crypto-native custodians.” He explained that the fund manager chose Standard Chartered “because of their global reputation, regulatory footprint, and risk-management standards” and added: “Many investors are familiar with traditional institutions, so partnering with a bank of this caliber helps us serve a broader client base while maintaining robust, institutional-grade custody.“ Byas-Perry explained that “some institutions prefer working with names they already know, while others rely on crypto-native specialists.” Still, he believes that 21Shares’ “job is to support both.” Standard Chartered had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication.

Here’s what that means Traditional finance takes on crypto Standard Chartered said 21Shares will work with its newly established digital asset custody service based in Luxembourg. The announcement follows the bank’s mid-July launch of a trading service that allows institutions and corporations to trade major cryptocurrencies . 21Shares’ global head of product development, Mandy Chiu, said the collaboration is “an important milestone in our continued mission to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem.” She pointed to the bank’s reputation in traditional finance as an advantage. “As one of the world’s most trusted financial institutions, Standard Chartered brings deep expertise in cross-border banking, risk management, and custody.“ Other major banks have taken similar steps. In September, US multinational financial services firm US Bancorp reentered the crypto space by relaunching its digital asset custody services aimed explicitly at investment managers. This follows the company’s launch of its custody service in 2021, which was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable regulations. Mid-August reports also note that Wall Street giant Citigroup is weighing plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and payment services . In July, Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, was also reported to be planning to allow its clients to store cryptocurrencies — amid a broader trend in the nation .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Asset manager VanEck backed away from its earlier plans to stake assets in its proposed spot BNB exchange-traded fund, despite offering staking in its recently launched Solana product. In its updated S-1 filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, VanEck said “the Trust will not employ its BNB in Staking Activities and accordingly will not earn any form of staking rewards or income of any kind from Staking Activities” at the time of listing. The filing further warns that “there can be no assurance that the Trust will engage in any Staking Activities” in the future, either. The company acknowledged that avoiding staking could cause the ETF’s performance to lag that of holding BNB ( BNB ) directly, noting that investors would forgo potential staking rewards. This follows VanEck filing for a spot BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) in May. The filing noted at the time that it “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the assets through one or more trusted staking providers.” Earlier this month, VanEck also launched the US’s third Solana ( SOL ) ETF, offering staking yields .

Source: SEC Related: Solana staking ETFs are ‘missing part of puzzle’: Bitwise CIO VanEck hints at BNB’s regulatory woes In its updated filing, VanEck distanced itself from any potential staking efforts and stated that it would be implemented through one or more third-party “Staking Services Providers.” Furthermore, the company clearly stated that there was no guarantee that any staking with ETF assets would ever take place, and if they were to engage in such activity, they would first file a prospectus with the SEC. “The Trust is not permitted to engage in Staking Activities, which could negatively affect the value of the Shares.” Still, the filing fails to clearly state the rationale for its cautious approach to BNB staking, but it hints at concerns regarding regulatory troubles. A section of the filing clearly states that a determination by the SEC that BNB is a security may adversely affect the value of the shares and the termination of the trust. “The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a ‘security’ is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict,” VanEck said. The fund manager “acknowledges that BNB may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security.” In such a case, VanEck may dissolve the ETF — either of its own volition by autonomously determining that BNB is a security or after the SEC or a federal court concludes that it is. “For so long as the Sponsor believes there to be good faith grounds to conclude that the Trust’s BNB is not a security, the Sponsor does not intend to dissolve the Trust on the basis that BNB could at some future point be determined to be a security,” the filing said. Related: Grayscale debuts Solana ETF, joining Bitwise in SOL staking ETF race BNB’s past brushes with the SEC As VanEck pointed out, in 2023, the SEC filed lawsuits against crypto exchange Binance , its US-based competitor, Coinbase , and Kraken for facilitating the trading of unregistered securities. The regulator deemed 68 digital assets to be securities at the time, including BNB. Still, in early July last year, a US federal court found that secondary sales of the BNB token did not constitute security transactions . Whether staking and cryptocurrencies that employ it fall under securities law has been subject to intense debate. Back in late May, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a statement that “Protocol Staking Activities” such as crypto staked in a proof-of-stake blockchain, “don’t need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act,” or fall within “one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration.” Still, this did not settle the debate. At the time, Caroline Crenshaw was the sole commissioner who opposed the guidance, saying it “fails to deliver a reliable roadmap for determining whether a staking service” is an investment contract under securities laws.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Despite steep redemptions from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, Solana attracted $369 million of inflows this month as investors increasingly positioned SOL as a yield-generating asset. According to Bohdan Opryshko, co-founder and chief operating officer of Everstake, both institutions and retail holders are “treating Solana as a yield-generating asset rather than a speculative trade.” He told Cointelegraph that Solana’s native staking rewards of 5%–7% have created an appeal that Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs cannot match, and only a limited set of Ethereum products currently offer. Between Nov. 3 and Nov. 24, Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.7 billion in net redemptions, while Ether ( ETH ) ETFs lost $1.64 billion, according to SoSoValue. Over the same period, Solana ( SOL ) staking ETFs drew $369 million in fresh inflows. Opryshko said this was “more than capital rotation,” pointing to a rising preference for yield-bearing exposure.

Whale delegators consolidated rather than exiting, with counts declining but the total stake remaining steady. Trezor users alone staked over 1 million SOL through Everstake during the month, Opryshko said. “This suggests crypto investing is bifurcating post-ETF approval: speculative assets (traded for appreciation) vs. productive assets (staked for income),” Opryshko added, claiming that for a growing part of the market, “staking yield has become a primary driver of allocation — not the only one, but increasingly central.” Related: SOL rebounds alongside wider crypto market bounce: Is $160 possible?

Solana-based ETFs attracted over $420 million in their debut week last month , showing appetite for liquid products that still provide native staking returns. “At the same time, data shows that retail delegators are becoming more long-term oriented, with delegation lifetimes steadily increasing throughout 2025 and participation remaining strong even amid volatility,” he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The SEC has just issued its second “no-action letter” toward a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) crypto project in recent months, giving its native token “regulatory cover” from enforcement. The no-action letter was sent to the Solana DePIN project Fuse, which issues a network token, FUSE, as a reward to those actively maintaining the network. Fuse initially submitted a letter to the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on Nov. 19, asking for official confirmation that it would not recommend the SEC take enforcement action if the project continues to offer and sell FUSE tokens. Fuse also outlined in its letter that FUSE is designed for network utility and consumptive purposes, not for speculation. They can only be redeemed for an average market price via third parties. “Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel, Fuse offers and sells the Tokens in the manner and under the circumstances described in your letter,” the Division of Corporation Finance’s deputy chief counsel, Jonathan Ingram, wrote on Monday. SEC’s no-action letter to Fuse Crypto. Source: SEC The latest SEC no-action letter comes just a few months after the SEC issued a similar “highly coveted” letter to Double Zero, which was seen as a result of a new, more crypto-friendly leadership at the SEC. At the time, DoubleZero co-founder Austin Federa said such letters are common in TradFi but are “very rare” in the crypto space. “It was a months long process, but we found the SEC to be quite receptive, we found them to be quite professional, quite diligent, there was no crypto animosity.” The SEC was put under new leadership in April, after Paul Atkins was sworn in as the 34th chairman, and the agency has since been seen taking a more balanced approach to crypto. As part of the leadership, crypto-friendly Hester Peirce also heads up the agency’s crypto task force. SEC no-action letters are a form of regulatory clarity Adding to the discussion on X, Rebecca Rettig, a legal representative of Solana MEV infrastructure platform Jito Labs, said that no-action letters are sought after by many crypto projects. “Why do crypto teams want them? ‘Regulatory clarity.’ If you're planning to issue a token, a NAL provides reasonable assurance you won’t face immediate enforcement for violations of securities laws. It’s a kind of ‘regulatory cover,’” she wrote. SEC giving a pass to Fuse wasn’t unexpected: Crypto lawyer The no-action letter doesn’t necessarily set any new precedents, however. Commenting on the subject via X on Monday, Consensys lawyer Bill Hughes said this was “an easy case,” given the nature of Fuse’s token. “The take away is that there is not a lawyer in crypto that would have thought this token was a security. And maybe not even any lawyer who is merely familiar with Howey,” Hughes said. Crypto founders praise SEC’s new leadership After an era in which many US crypto founders, businesses and projects said they felt hostility from the SEC under former chair Gary Gensler , the latest interaction with Fuse indicates the agency has dramatically shifted its approach . Related: SEC to hold privacy and financial surveillance roundtable in December The same month that Double Zero secured its no-action letter, the SEC also issued a similar no-action letter for crypto-custodians that don’t qualify as banks.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Financial stability experts at the European Central Bank (ECB) said stablecoin-related risks in the euro area are limited due to low adoption and preventative regulation. The ECB on Monday published its financial stability review pre-release, devoting it to the growing market of stablecoins , which are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currencies or commodities. Authored by ECB financial stability experts Senne Aerts, Claudia Lambert and Elisa Reinhold, the report questioned stablecoin use cases beyond crypto trading and highlighted their low financial stability risks in the euro area. “Currently, financial stability risks stemming from stablecoins are limited within the euro area, but the rapid growth justifies close monitoring, while risks stemming from cross-border regulatory arbitrage should be resolved,” the report said. Crypto trading remains a key use case for stablecoins “At present, crypto trading constitutes by far the most important use case for stablecoins,” the authors said, adding that other use cases, such as cross-border payments, “play only a minor role.” Citing a July study by the International Monetary Fund, the report said that a large share of stablecoin flows were cross-border, but noted a lack of evidence that these flows were systemically linked to remittances. The report also highlighted limited stablecoin use in retail transactions, referring to Visa’s estimates that only about 0.5% of stablecoin volumes were organic, retail-sized transfers (less than $250).

US dollar stablecoins are less interconnected with euro markets With stablecoins not being widely used for transactions involving real-world assets, especially within the euro area, the stablecoin market does not pose urgent financial stability risks for Europe, the report said. And although US dollar-pegged stablecoins — such as Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) — dominate the market at a whopping 84%, their interconnections with euro area financial markets are limited.

Bitcoin investor Strategy is facing a rough stretch this year, prompting speculation that its high-conviction Bitcoin play is coming undone. A look beyond the one-year chart tells a different story. Google Finance data shows that Strategy (MSTR) stock is down almost 60% over the last year, and has declined by over 40% year-to-date (YTD). The stock traded near $300 in October, before dropping to about $170 at the time of writing. While some interpret this as its Bitcoin model being “exposed,” Strategy is still sitting on double-digit profits on its Bitcoin purchases, and its long-term equity performance continues to outpace major tech stocks. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data, Strategy acquired its Bitcoin ( BTC ) at an average price of $74,430. With Bitcoin trading at around $86,000, Strategy is still up nearly 16% on its BTC investments. Over a five-year window, Strategy shares are up by more than 500%, according to Google Finance data.

Strategy stock is still up over 500% in the last five years. Source: Google Finance Investors are shorting Strategy as a hedge for crypto longs The slump might have less to do with Bitcoin’s fundamentals and more to do with how the biggest investors hedge their crypto exposure. In a recent CNBC interview, BitMine chairman Tom Lee explained that Strategy has become the easiest way to hedge Bitcoin. “Someone can use MicroStrategy’s options chain, which is so liquid, to hedge all of their crypto,” he said. “The only convenient way to hedge someone’s long is to short MicroStrategy or buy puts.” This dynamic turned Strategy into an unintended pressure valve for the crypto market, absorbing hedges, shorts and volatility and market anxiety that may have little to do with its underlying Bitcoin strategy and the effectiveness of its long-term thesis. Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, said that a big risk is a drop in BTC prices that would force Strategy to liquidate its holdings. This could add downward pressure on both Strategy stock and BTC prices. “We are probably a long way from this. But the risk makes abundantly clear that in the long run, buying MSTR stock is potentially inferior to owning actual Bitcoin,” Rodda said. He added that while MSTR stock can effectively disappear, one Bitcoin will always be worth one Bitcoin.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Grayscale has said that Chainlink will be at the center of the next major phase of blockchain adoption, referring to the project as the “critical connective tissue” that links crypto to traditional finance. In a recent research report , the asset manager argued that Chainlink ( LINK )’s growing suite of software tools is emerging as essential infrastructure for tokenization, crosschain settlement and the broader shift toward real-world assets on blockchain rails. “A more accurate description of Chainlink today would be modular middleware that lets on-chain applications safely use off-chain data, interact across blockchains, and meet enterprise-grade compliance needs,” Grayscale wrote. The company added that this expanding footprint has helped turn LINK into the largest non–layer 1 crypto asset by market cap (excluding stablecoins), giving investors exposure to multiple ecosystems rather than a single chain.

Today, nearly all financial assets, from securities to real estate, are still recorded on off-chain ledgers. For these assets to gain the efficiency and programmability of blockchains, they must be tokenized, verified and connected to external data sources. “We expect Chainlink to play a central role orchestrating the process of tokenization, and it has announced a variety of partnerships, including with S&P Global and FTSE/Russel, that should help it do so,” the asset manager wrote.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The leading Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer, Bitmain, which is based in China, is reportedly under investigation in the US over national security concerns. According to a Friday Bloomberg report , an unspecified US official and six other anonymous people familiar with the matter said that Bitmain’s hardware is at the center of a federal investigation known as “Operation Red Sunset.” The investigation, led by the US Department of Homeland Security, reportedly seeks to determine whether the ASICs could be remotely controlled for spying or to sabotage the US power grid. US authorities previously investigated Bitmain-linked Chinese chip designer Xiamen Sophgo over an alleged business relationship with US-sanctioned company Huawei in October 2024. This was followed by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency halting the delivery of thousands of Bitmain ASICs the following month. Authorities only began releasing the hardware in March this year. Consequences for the US crypto mining industry could be far-reaching, since Bitmain controls over 80% of the Bitcoin mining ASIC market, according to a Cambridge report . Chinese dominance in the industry is even more ironclad, with both Bitmain and the second-largest manufacturer, MicroBT, based in mainland China, controlling 97% of the market share on their own.

Instead, the company representative claimed that it “strictly complies with US and applicable laws and regulations and has never engaged in activities that pose risks to US national security,” and is unaware of the investigation. Donald Trump’s skin in the game Imposing restrictive measures on Bitmain machines is also likely to lead to consequences for US President Donald Trump ’s family.

US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings also reveal that American Bitcoin “paid through the pledge of Bitcoin” with a “redemption period of 24 months from each pledge date,” terms which The Guardian reports are unusually generous. With Bitmain so dominant in the space, American Bitcoin is far from the only major US-based crypto mining company that may be affected by the findings of this investigation.

The $3.79 billion withdrawal puts November on track to be the worst month on record for US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF outflows if the remaining days fail to offset this month’s redemptions.

The fund also led this week’s outflows with $1.02 billion. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of analytics platform CryptoQuant, flagged this week’s performance as IBIT’s “largest weekly outflow ever.” Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed as the second-largest outflow driver in November with monthly outflows of $1.09 billion. Just this week, the issuer has seen $225.9 million withdrawn so far, reflecting moderate but persistent redemptions. While FBTC’s outflows remain smaller than IBIT’s, both funds contributed to the broader liquidity drain that pushed November past February’s record for the heaviest month of Bitcoin ETF outflows. Together, they account for 91% of total US spot BTC ETF outflows in November.

The MSCI Index announced in October that it was consulting with the investment community about whether to exclude Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital asset treasury companies (DATs) that have a balance sheet with more than 50% crypto assets. Some of the feedback has been that DATs can “exhibit characteristics similar to investment funds, which are currently not eligible for index inclusion,” according to the MSCI. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Charlie Sherry, Head of Finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in his view, the odds of the MSCI excluding DATs are “solidly in favour of it,” as the index “only puts changes like this into consultation when they’re already leaning that way.” The consultation is open until Dec. 31, with the conclusion to be made public on Jan. 15 next year, and any resulting changes coming into force during February. Input is also being sought about whether additional parameters should be considered, such as if a company defines itself as a DAT, or has raised capital primarily to accumulate crypto . If the MSCI decides to exclude DATs, Sharry said index-tracking funds would need to sell, and that alone creates meaningful pressure on the affected names. A preliminary list notes 38 crypto companies on MSCI’s radar, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy , Sharplink Gaming, and crypto miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings, among others. The MSCI lists at least 38 crypto companies that could be affected by its decision. Source: MSCI “When most of the value comes from a balance-sheet asset rather than the underlying business, MSCI treats that as outside the scope of a traditional equity benchmark,” Sherry said. “It’s a risk-management decision designed to keep indexes aligned with predictable business fundamentals.” “This also marks a shift in tone from the past year. Crypto-heavy corporate strategies were applauded as a capital markets innovation. Now the large index providers are tightening their definitions, and it shows that the market is moving out of its everything is adoption phase and back toward a more conservative filter.” A Wednesday note from JPMorgan analysts warned that Strategy could shed $2.8 billion if the MSCI moves ahead, and roughly $9 billion of its estimated $56 billion market value is sitting in passive funds tracked by indexes, Bloomberg reports . Source: Matthew Sigel Unclear if other indexes could follow suit Sherry said it’s “hard to call at this stage” if the MSCI’s decision would influence other index providers. “Index providers often watch each other’s moves, but they don’t always move in lockstep. S&P’s treatment of MicroStrategy shows there’s precedent for taking a stricter view, yet each provider has its own methodology and client base to consider,” he said. Related: Strategy steps up Bitcoin buys with 8,178 BTC purchase “If MSCI makes a change, it could open the door for others to review their own rules, but it doesn’t guarantee a chain reaction.” Strategy still appears on track for possible inclusion in the S&P 500 , according to crypto market intelligence company 10X Research, which also predicted in October that there was a 70% chance it will be added to the index before the end of the year. Clearer rules are good for crypto Meanwhile, Sherry also said, clearer rules around corporate classification ultimately help the space. “When companies understand exactly how their treasury decisions will be treated, it removes uncertainty for both issuers and investors,” he added. “Well-defined frameworks tend to strengthen long-term institutional confidence, even if the short-term impact is uncomfortable for stocks built around Bitcoin holdings.” Magazine: Bitcoin to see ‘one more big thrust’ to $150K, ETH pressure builds # Bitcoin # Blockchain # Cryptocurrencies # Altcoins # Business # Stocks # Stock Market Indexes Add reaction","Stephen Katte Nov 21, 2025 MSCI index likely to kick out crypto treasuries, exec warns If the MSCI decides to exclude digital asset treasuries, index-tracking funds would need to sell, and that alone “creates meaningful pressure on the affected names.” Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL F",CoinTelegraph,2025-11-21 05:37:17+00:00,2025-12-07 11:19:24.130489,2025-12-07T19:16:39.991935

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force has scheduled a roundtable discussion centered on privacy and financial surveillance for December, as a renewed focus on privacy grips the cryptocurrency industry. The privacy roundtable is slated for Dec. 15. Like other SEC roundtables, crypto industry executives and SEC officials will discuss common pain points and solutions, but no hard policy proposals will be submitted. Privacy has become a hot-button topic following several developments, including the partial guilty verdict in Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm’s trial in June, the Samourai Wallet developer sentencing in November and the privacy token price rally over the last two months. Privacy tokens like Zcash experienced a price surge beginning in October. Source: CoinMarketCap “Authoritarians thrive when people have no privacy. When those in charge start being hostile to privacy protections, it is a major red flag,” said Naomi Brockwell, founder of the Ludlow Institute, an organization advocating for liberty through technology. The renewed interest in privacy hearkens back to crypto’s cypherpunk roots , and one of the core reasons the cryptographic technology that underpins crypto was invented — to ensure secure communication channels between parties in hostile environments. Related: Crypto investors flee visibility for anonymity as privacy coins surge 80% Crypto community sounds alarm about privacy following precedent-setting legal cases The verdict in the Storm trial and other cases where open-source software developers have been convicted or imprisoned for creating non-custodial, privacy-preserving protocols has set a dangerous precedent for privacy technology in the US, legal experts have said. Crypto industry executives and advocates argue that the prosecutions are meant to dissuade developers from building privacy-preserving tools. The verdict in the Samourai Wallet case is analogous to the US government accusing car manufacturer Toyota of a conspiracy because terrorists and criminals also use their cars, according to journalist and crypto advocate Lola Leetz. “People should not be held accountable for what other people do with the tools they build,” Leetz said . In August, Matthew Galeotti, the acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s criminal division, signaled the agency would no longer prosecute open-source software developers for writing code. “Our view is that merely writing code, without ill intent, is not a crime,” Galeotti said . “The department will not use indictments as a law-making tool.

This shows that while there’s a broad outflow trend, not all investors are exiting. Some appear to be buying the dip or re-entering ahead of potential year-end catalysts.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The co-founders of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai Wallet were sentenced to four and five years in prison Wednesday, setting an important precedent as privacy development makes a comeback in crypto. Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill were sentenced on Wednesday for conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and for facilitating transactions involving criminal proceeds, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said. Prosecutors argued that Samourai’s CoinJoin mixing service helped conceal the movement of illicit funds, even though the wallet was fully non-custodial. “The sentences the defendants received send a clear message that laundering known criminal proceeds—regardless of the technology used or whether the proceeds are in the form of fiat or cryptocurrency — will face serious consequences,” US Attorney Nicolas Roos said. The sentencing follows their arrest in April 2024 and their release on a $1 million bond after pleading not guilty in late April of last year. In late July, the co-founders said they would change their plea to guilty ahead of the recent sentencing. The shuttering of Samourai also led to the development of an open-source alternative to Ashigaru in September 2024. The control-based argument for money transmission Despite never having control over the Bitcoin ( BTC ) being mixed, Samourai coordinated the mixing through its Whirlpool CoinJoin implementation, which the judge found sufficient to rule that it constituted a money transmission service. Court documents clearly noted that “all Whirlpool transactions are coordinated by Samourai’s server,” and broadcasting “Ricochet” transactions to the Bitcoin network. Prosecutors said this amounted to transferring funds on behalf of customers without the licensing required by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

Source: Samourai Wallet Related: Chat Control stumbles again as EU retreats from mandatory scanning Non-custodial is not enough, real decentralization is key Similar to the Tornado Cash crypto mixer case, the arguments used in the prosecution of the Samourai Wallet co-founders demonstrate that complete decentralization is crucial for avoiding prosecution when implementing crypto privacy systems. The DOJ pointed out that the co-founders “created the core features of Tornado Cash, paid for critical infrastructure to operate it, promoted the service, and made millions in profits.” The DOJ also noted that the co-founders “chose not to implement Know Your Customer or Anti-Money Laundering programs as required by law” for money transmitting businesses. Still, this remains an active area of litigation, with the crypto community recognizing that it is in a constant battle with the state over what it feels is its right to privacy. In October, Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm asked decentralized finance developers , “How can you be so sure you won’t be charged by the DOJ as a money service business for building a non-custodial protocol?” He argued that the DOJ could claim that any decentralized, non-custodial service should have been developed as a custodial service, since he was prosecuted for failing to implement centralized control measures. Related: Privacy coins are not radical; surveillance money is Both sides score points In January, privacy advocates scored a win when a US court overturned the sanctions against Tornado Cash. The appeal read that the smart contracts employed by the protocol are not property, so they cannot be blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “overstepped its congressionally defined authority.” US Judge Don Willett, who authored the opinion , said he recognizes “the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority.” He said it’s up to Congress, not the courts, to address the issue: “We decline the Department’s invitation to judicial lawmaking… Legislating is Congress’s job—and Congress’s alone.” Just as in the Samourai Wallet case, Storm was found guilty only of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Still, last month, he asked a US federal judge to acquit him of his sole conviction , arguing that prosecutors failed to prove he intended to help bad actors misuse the crypto mixer — a lack of willfulness that defense claims is necessary for the conviction. In August comments, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Matthew Galeotti, suggested that the department would pursue “even-handed enforcement of the law.” Without explicitly mentioning the Tornado Cash or Samourai Wallet cases, he hinted at a new direction in instances involving allegations of operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business. “Our view is that merely writing code, without ill intent, is not a crime,” said Galeotti.

Crypto investment platform M2 treasury manager, Zayed Aleem, said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that it is “fantastic to see such institutional conviction and another strong signal that the UAE is securing its place as a global hub for digital assets.” Echoing a similar sentiment, crypto commentator MartyParty said that “the position reflects a strategic bet on BTC’s role as a store of value.” The news comes just one day after IBIT experienced its most significant daily outflows since its January 2024 launch, totaling $523.2 million, according to Farside, amid Bitcoin briefly falling to $88,000.

BlackRock did not add staking to its spot Ethereum product, stating on its website: “No, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF will not stake its ether at this time. Staking involves operational complexities and regulatory issues that currently make it unfeasible.” However, in July, they proposed a rule change with the SEC to incorporate staking into ETHA, along with other issuers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently introduced a generic listing standard enabling faster approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF product is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires strong transparency and investor protection measures, as well as full disclosure before shares can be publicly sold. There are currently around 70 crypto products awaiting regulatory approval, which were held up by the US government shutdown across October and November. Related: Stablecoins strengthen the dollar and empower the developing world BlackRock’s filing comes as REX-Osprey and Grayscale launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October.

It could therefore broaden the product’s appeal to yield-focused investors who may have avoided Ethereum ETF products due to their lack of income. The average annual return on ETH staking is approximately 3.95%, according to Blocknative data.

According to the Senate calendar, the Agriculture Committee is scheduled to discuss his nomination on Thursday. Addressing DeFi, crypto enforcement, roles of agency The prospective CFTC chair responded to questions from the committee chair, Senator John Boozman, who advocated for the agency to take a leading role in regulating spot digital commodity markets. The senator’s remarks came as the committee is expected to consider a market structure bill that would give the CFTC more authority to regulate crypto. “The CFTC, and only the CFTC, should regulate the trading of digital commodities,” said Boozman.

He added that it was “vitally important that we have a cop on the beat” in response to a question on regulating crypto, specifically spot digital asset commodity markets.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has fallen nearly 12% over the past week to $91,616, shaving off the gains it’s made so far in 2025, according to CoinMarketCap. Saylor said that when he began buying Bitcoin for Strategy in 2020, the asset carried an annualized volatility of about 80%. Since then, he said, it has trended lower to now sit around 50%.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Nov. 19, 2025, at 6:15 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by an International Monetary Fund representative. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, says it has bought more than $100 million in BTC despite pledging to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to limit public exposure to the asset as part of a loan agreement. According to data from El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, the government acquired 1,090 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth more than $100 million on Tuesday. The purchase comes after the IMF said in a July report that the Central American nation had not bought any new Bitcoin since the organization approved a $1.4 billion loan program at the end of 2024. According to El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve data, the country’s Bitcoin holdings went from 5,968 BTC on Dec. 18, 2024 — when the government inked a deal with the IMF — to over 7,474 BTC following its latest purchase announcement. El Salvador’s reserves were valued at roughly $683 million at the time of writing, despite Bitcoin losing ground after falling 28% from an all-time high of over $126,000 in early October to $96,000 at the time of writing. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve balance chart. Source: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office The move follows comments in July from Quentin Ehrenmann, general manager at My First Bitcoin — a non-governmental organization focused on Bitcoin adoption — who said that El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve had a limited impact on the broader population . He said that “since the government entered into this contract with the IMF, Bitcoin is no longer legal tender, and we haven’t seen any other effort to educate people.” “The government, apparently, continues to accumulate Bitcoin, which is beneficial for the government — it’s not directly good for the people.“ An IMF representative told Cointelegraph that El Salvador’s government committed “not to increase the overall amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets.” The spokesperson said that they “are not going to provide a running commentary on each Bitcoin-related announcement” but instead “will assess in due course” El Salvador’s adherence to commitments. The Salvadoran government did not respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment by publication. Related: Pro-Bitcoin restaurant Steak 'n Shake announces El Salvador expansion Is El Salvador buying Bitcoin or not? Data from El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office appears to show that the government has continued to accumulate BTC since signing the IMF agreement. The IMF also requested that the country restrict Bitcoin purchases in early March , in accordance with the terms of the previous loan agreement. Still, a letter of intent signed by El Salvador’s central bank president and Minister of Finance — quoted in the aforementioned July IMF report — claims that the Central American country bought no Bitcoin since the 2024 loan. The IMF report explained that Chivo “does not adjust its Bitcoin reserves to reflect changes in clients’ Bitcoin deposits,” which led to “minor” discrepancies that made it appear that El Salvador’s public sector was accumulating BTC. Related: My First Bitcoin ends El Salvador program, pivots to global BTC education The letter, signed by Salvadoran officials, further stated that “in line with commitments under the program, the stock of Bitcoins held by the public sector remains unchanged.” It also promised that steps to reduce exposure are being taken. “We are taking steps to mitigate fiscal risks by reducing the public sector’s role in the Chivo wallet and reframing the Bitcoin project.” Those assurances came before the latest — and unusually large — Bitcoin purchase. Even so, the government has continued to suggest it was steadily accumulating BTC before this week’s buy, raising fresh questions over how closely it is adhering to the IMF deal and how its Bitcoin reserves are being reported.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Grab, Southeast Asia’s largest super-app, is taking a deeper step into stablecoin infrastructure with a new exploratory agreement with StraitsX, a Singapore-based stablecoin issuer. The two companies announced on Tuesday that they had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to develop a Web3-enabled settlement layer that brings digital asset wallets, programmable payments and stablecoin-based clearing into everyday consumer experiences. If approved by regulators and implemented, the system would allow Grab users to hold and spend StraitsX-issued tokens like XSGD and XUSD directly within the app, which is available in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia and Myanmar. With Grab’s extensive reach in Southeast Asia, the move could significantly reshape how cross-border retail payments operate in the region. “Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest-growing digital economies, but payments remain fragmented and costly,” said Tianwei Liu, co-founder and CEO of StraitsX, adding that the collaboration will accelerate the growth in the region’s digital economy. Grab application in the Philippines allows crypto and stablecoin top-ups. Source: Grab app Grab’s history with stablecoins This is not the first time that Grab has dipped into the stablecoin space. The company tested blockchain-based rewards, collaborations with Web3 wallets and limited pilots to assess user readiness. In 2023, Grab partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to pilot Web3 customer experiences in Singapore. This allowed users to set up a blockchain wallet, earn rewards and use non-fungible token (NFT) vouchers. In 2024, Grab started allowing users to top up their GrabPay wallets using crypto and stablecoins. On May 6, Grab partnered with Natix , a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) operating in Solana, to combine blockchain-based mapping with Grab’s camera hardware and mapmaking technology. While Grab is not new to stablecoins and blockchain, the deal marks an escalation from its previous experiments. It signals a much broader ambition, which is selecting a default onchain settlement rail that could underpin all major markets where Grab operates. Instead of simply using stablecoins, Grab is exploring the more fundamental question of which stablecoin infrastructure should power its future payment flows. “Grab sees potential for Web3 technologies to improve cross-border retail payments while providing a familiar experience for users,” said Kell Jay Lim, the head of Grab Financial. He said that they will work with StraitsX to solve some of these challenges for their merchants and consumers. Related: UBS and Ant bet on blockchain to break bottleneck in global treasury flows A bigger Web3 implementation within the Grab app At the core of the proposal is a Web3 wallet embedded inside the Grab application. This would allow users to perform cross-border payments, convert between fiat and stablecoins and even receive funds from external Web3 wallets. With this, merchants will also receive Web3-compatible wallets that offer programmable settlement, onchain treasury tools and real-time clearing. This could lower fees compared to card networks and reduce liquidity challenges. While the initiative sounds promising, it would still depend on regulatory clearances across the jurisdictions that Grab operates in, with each implementing different supervision models for stablecoins, e-money and digital assets. However, the intention is clear, and it’s to build an interoperable settlement layer to replace the current siloed, higher-cost cross-border flows.

On Monday, the SEC’s Division of Examinations released its examination priorities for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2026, which made no specific mention of crypto or digital assets. However, the SEC said that its stated priorities are not “an exhaustive list of all the areas the Division will focus on in the upcoming year.” The US crypto industry has boomed under Trump, who has largely worked to deregulate the sector while his family has expanded their footprint into crypto with a trading platform, mining business, stablecoin and token. “Examinations are an important component to accomplishing the agency’s mission, but they should not be a ’gotcha’ exercise,” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement.

The examination division also wrote a section dedicated to crypto assets and emerging financial technology in 2023. In its latest priorities list, the SEC said it was focusing on “core areas,” including fiduciary duty, custody and customer information protection.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The number of Bitcoin whale wallets has spiked as the crypto markets struggled this week, with Bitcoin sinking as low as $89,550 on Tuesday. Data from the crypto analytics platform Glassnode shows that whales have been accumulating since late October, with a notable spike in the number of Bitcoin whale wallets holding above 1,000 BTC starting Friday. Whale wallets’ numbers fell to a yearly low of 1,354 on Oct. 27 — when BTC was trading at around $114,000 — but as of Monday, this number has spiked 2.2% to sit at 1,384, in levels not seen in four months.

The total number of these wallets has decreased from 980,577 on Oct. 27 to hit a yearly low of 977,420 on Nov. 17. Wallets with 1 BTC or more have tanked in 2025.

Commenting on these dynamics, 10X Research‘s Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph that there is some whale selling still going on, as he stressed that Oct. 29 FOMC meeting from the US Federal Reserve has had a huge impact on what we are seeing now. “His message decisively broke the fragile balance that had existed between market sellers and buyers – between the OG mega whale sellers (1,000-10,000 BTC) and the whale buyers (100-1,000 BTC).” “Super-whales and mega-whales are absorbing some of the whale selling, but the 30-day net-flow ratio between these cohorts still shows decisive net selling,” he added. Bitcoin drops below $90K Bitcoin dipped below a crucial psychological level on Monday, and is currently trading at around $89,900. This has seen the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drop down to the “extreme-fear” zone with a score of 11 out of 100. While some may be feeling the pressure, executives from firms such as Bitwise and BitMine have tipped BTC selling pressure to subside and hit a bottom this week. Speaking with CNBC on Monday, Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan argued that current price levels are a “generational opportunity.” Related: Rare Bitcoin futures signal could catch traders off-guard: Is a bottom forming? “I think we’re nearing a bottom.

The financing comes with unusual terms for a crypto-related company: a 0% interest rate, no ongoing interest payments and no requirement to post additional collateral if the price of Ether ( ETH ) falls, the company announced Monday. These features mean Republic does not have to spend cash servicing the debt and cannot default for failing to make interest payments — a common issue for highly leveraged digital-asset companies.

In a Financial Times interview, Sleijpen warned that the fast-growing dollar-pegged stablecoins could become systemically relevant to Europe’s financial ecosystem. He said that if the tokens were to destabilize, they could affect financial stability, the wider economy and even inflation. “If stablecoins are not that stable, you could end up in a situation where the underlying assets need to be sold quickly,” he said, underscoring that rapid liquidation could amplify stress across markets.

Tether’s USDt ( USDT ), the top US dollar-pegged stablecoin on the market, grew from a $127 billion market cap in November 2024 to a $183 billion market cap over the past year, marking a 44% increase. USDC ( USDC ), the second-largest stablecoin asset, grew by nearly 100% from $37 billion to $74 billion during the same time. In April, the US Department of the Treasury reported that evolving market dynamics have the potential to accelerate the growth of stablecoins. The Treasury predicted that stablecoins could reach a $2 trillion market cap by 2028. Sleijpen said that as dollar-pegged stablecoins continue to grow, the sector could reach a scale where their fluctuations would directly matter to Europe’s economic outlook. Related: EU mulls SEC-like oversight for stock, crypto exchanges to bolster startup landscape Concerns over dollar-backed stablecoins in Europe In April, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone wrote an article highlighting concerns about the growth of dollar-backed stablecoins. He argued that launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could help preserve monetary sovereignty in the eurozone. He said that a digital euro can limit the potential for foreign currency stablecoins to become a more common medium of exchange in Europe. Italy’s Minister of Economy and Finance, Giancarlo Giorgetti, also expressed concerns over US dollar stablecoins . In April, Giorgetti stated that stablecoins pose a more significant threat to European financial stability than trade tariffs. While concerns over stablecoins were apparent, Sleijpen’s comments highlight a more pressing concern: that stablecoin issuers could become vectors for financial instability. If large issuers offload reserves at scale, a contagion could extend into liquidity conditions, asset prices and inflation.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing an overhaul of the country’s crypto regulatory framework, moving to classify digital assets as “financial products” under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The plan would introduce mandatory disclosures for 105 cryptocurrencies listed on domestic exchanges, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ), and bring them under insider trading regulations for the first time, according to a Sunday report from Asahi Shinmun. If enacted, exchanges would be required to disclose detailed information about each of the 105 tokens they list, including whether the asset has an identifiable issuer, the blockchain technology underpinning it and its volatility profile, per the report. The FSA reportedly plans to bring the new crypto-related law proposal to Japan’s main parliamentary meeting in 2026 for approval.

Japan currently taxes crypto earnings as “miscellaneous income,” meaning high-earning traders can face rates of up to 55%, one of the steepest systems in the world. The agency now wants gains on the 105 approved cryptocurrencies to be taxed similarly to stocks, at a flat 20% capital gains rate. Another notable part of the proposal is the attempt to curb insider trading in the local crypto market. Under the bill, individuals or entities with access to non-public information, such as upcoming listings, delisting plans or an issuer’s financial distress, would be prohibited from buying or selling affected tokens.

Peck explained that although many new investors now understand the concept of Bitcoin ( BTC ), they often struggle to judge the “next 20 range of assets.” He said a multi-asset crypto basket provides them with exposure to the sector while mitigating the “idiosyncratic risk” of investing in individual tokens. Will Peck says index ETF investors will be backing the tech “Crypto we talked about as an asset class, but it’s really a technology, and the underlying return drivers of each of these tokens are actually quite different, even though they’re correlated, generally, just because that’s where the market is,” he explained. Will Peck spoke to Cointelegraph at The Bridge conference in New York City on Wednesday. Source: Cointelegraph It comes as several crypto index ETFs have launched this year. Most recently, on Thursday, asset manager 21Shares launched two crypto Index ETFs, which are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Just a couple of months prior, on Sept. 25, asset manager Hashdex expanded its Crypto Index US ETF to include XRP ( XRP ), SOL ( SOL ), and Stellar ( XLM ),  following the generic listing rule change from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Peck said the timing of broader adoption for crypto index ETFs is “tough exactly to forecast,” but suggested it may be inevitable given the straightforward utility of having a product that provides such exposure. Peck expects a surge in new crypto ETF launches as ETF issuers compete for early advantage, which he said may erode the idea that an ETF automatically signals the cryptocurrency token has any authority or credibility. Bitcoin ETF success “surpassed” Will Peck’s expectations “I think it’s going to be a shift, like, where, five years ago, you said, Oh, if something has an ETF, like, Bitcoin is going to get one, maybe it’s the first one, it must have some sort of institutional stamp of, like, approval,” he said. “I don’t think that’s necessarily how the SEC should be, a merit-based regulator in that regard, right? And it’s really going to be on clients making the right choices with their own money,” Peck added. Meanwhile, Peck said that the “overall success” of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024 has surpassed his expectations. Related: Crypto treasuries and blockchain are paving the way for decentralized science “It’s remarkable to me how big the Bitcoin ETF categories, crypto in general, is one of the most competitive parts of the US ETF market,” he said.

Jeff Park says it just “makes sense” Park also said that treating crypto as a commodity is consistent with the international nature of the market. “It makes sense that the CFTC be the regulator who can look at the broader section of global commodities markets and coming up with rulemaking,” he said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Stablecoin issuer Tether is expanding its presence in commodity lending, with billions of dollars already deployed in the sector, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. In an interview with Bloomberg , Ardoino said Tether has extended about $1.5 billion in credit to commodities traders so far, providing financing in both cash and its USDt ( USDT ) stablecoin. The company is targeting traditional commodity trades, including agricultural products and oil, and plans to increase its exposure. “We are going to expand dramatically,” Ardoino said. The lending activity falls within Tether’s recently launched Trade Finance unit — a business line that typically focuses on short-term credit used to facilitate the movement of goods across global supply chains. In the commodities world, trade finance typically provides the funding traders need to purchase, transport and deliver cargoes. Bloomberg reported that some companies may be hesitant to borrow in USDt rather than dollars, though that reluctance might be outweighed by Tether’s growing financial clout. With nearly $184 billion worth of USDt in circulation, Tether is now among the most profitable companies in the world on a per-employee basis. Tether’s push into commodities builds on its existing footprint in the sector. Its tokenized gold product, Tether Gold , has surged in size during the bullion’s rally, and Ardoino recently said the company holds more than 100 tons of physical gold.

USDt was originally created to give crypto traders a dollar-linked asset at a time when the industry struggled to access traditional banking services. Since then, stablecoins have evolved into a mainstream financial tool used for remittances, cross-border payments and onchain settlement — valued for their speed, low cost and round-the-clock transferability. That growth has turned Tether into one of the highest-earning companies in the digital-asset industry, enabling the company’s diversification into trade finance, commodities, AI and other ventures. The total stablecoin market is now valued at more than $300 billion. USDT’s dominance is about 60%.

JPMorgan continues to expand the use of its blockchain-based JPM Coin for institutional payments, while Citigroup has launched tokenized deposit and settlement pilots.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the record 43-day US government shutdown, after the bill passed through the Senate on Monday and was approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The bill provides funding to the government until Jan. 30, 2026, and gives Democrats and Republicans more time to strike a deal on broader funding plans for the year ahead. The end of the shutdown failed to lift demand among Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) buyers. Spot BTC ETFs saw a brief resurgence on Tuesday, attracting $524 million in inflows , but outflows quickly resumed, with a whopping $866 million in daily net outflows on Thursday, according to Farside Investors.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at The Bridge conference in New York City on Wednesday, Hougan said a crypto market rally at the end of 2025 would have fit the four-year cycle thesis, meaning 2026 would mark the start of a bear market, similar to 2022 and 2018. When asked to revise his prediction about whether the crypto market will boom in 2026, Hougan said: “I’m actually more confident in that quote. The biggest risk was [if] we ripped into the end of 2025 and then we got a pullback.” Hougan said interest in the Bitcoin debasement trade, stablecoins and tokenization would continue to accelerate, while arguing that Uniswap’s fee switch proposal introduced on Monday would reinvigorate interest in decentralized finance protocols in the coming year. “I think the underlying fundamentals are just so sound,” Hougan said. “I think these earlier forces, institutional investment, regulatory progress, stablecoins, tokenization, I just think those are too big to keep down.

The Trustless Manifesto, also authored by Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner, said crypto platforms sacrifice trustlessness from the first moment that they integrate a hosted node or centralized relayer, explaining that while it feels harmless, it becomes a habit, and with each passing checkpoint, the protocol becomes less and less permissionless. “Trustlessness is not a feature to add after the fact. It is the thing itself,” the Ethereum Foundation members said in the manifesto published Wednesday. “Without it, everything else — efficiency, UX, scalability — is decoration on a fragile core.” “When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point.” Extract from The Trustless Manifesto.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The cross-border e-commerce arm of Chinese tech behemoth Alibaba is working on a deposit token amid mainland China’s crackdown on stablecoins, according to CNBC. Alibaba president Kuo Zhang told CNBC in a Friday report that the tech giant plans to use stablecoin-like technology to streamline overseas transactions. The model under consideration is a deposit token, which is a blockchain-based instrument that represents a direct claim on commercial bank deposits and is treated as a regulated liability of the issuing bank. Traditional stablecoins , which these tokens closely resemble, are issued by a private entity and backed by assets to maintain their value. The report follows JPMorgan Chase — the world’s biggest bank by market capitalization — reportedly rolling out its deposit token to institutional clients earlier this week. The news also follows reports that Chinese technology giants, including Ant Group and JD.com, suspended plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong after regulators in Beijing expressed displeasure with the plans . The report was just the latest of many suggesting that mainland Chinese authorities appear dead set on preventing a stablecoin industry from arising in the country. Alibaba offices.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Aave Labs became one of the first major decentralized finance (DeFi) projects to secure authorization under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, allowing the company to offer regulated stablecoin ramps across the European Economic Area (EEA). The approval enables “Push,” Aave Labs’ fiat-to-crypto service, to let users convert between euros and crypto assets, including the Aave protocol’s native stablecoin, GHO. The Central Bank of Ireland granted the authorization to Push Virtual Assets Ireland Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aave Labs. The company selected Ireland for its European operations, signaling that the country is becoming a preferred hub for compliant onchain finance under MiCA. On June 25, the crypto exchange Kraken secured its MiCA authorization in Ireland , allowing it to expand its offerings across Europe.

While the protocol introduced the product as a “zero-fee” solution, it did not specify whether this fee structure was permanent or tied to an introductory period. Aave Labs said a compliant payment infrastructure is foundational to developers hoping to onboard mainstream users into DeFi. By providing a predictable, audited pathway between euros and crypto assets, Push could reduce one of the biggest frictions in DeFi adoption: the dependence on CEXs for fiat-to-crypto conversions.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the regulatory body overseeing banks in the US, is reportedly considering guidance for tokenized deposit insurance and plans to launch an application process for stablecoins by year’s end. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill, who has made bullish statements about tokenization in the past, told the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Fintech Conference on Thursday that the regulator will eventually release guidance around tokenized deposit insurance, according to reports. The FDIC protects depositors in the event of a bank failure and insures money in accounts at banks that are insured by the regulator. “My view for a long time has been that a deposit is a deposit. Moving a deposit from a traditional-finance world to a blockchain or distributed-ledger world shouldn’t change the legal nature of it,” Hill said, as reported by Bloomberg. Strong interest in tokenization Regulators and Wall Street have shown serious interest in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector this year. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year , with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one of the most prominent players in the space and launched a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL in 2024.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Employees who were furloughed during the US government shutdown are expected to return to work at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission after 43 days away. According to the operations plans with the SEC and CFTC, staff are expected to return on Thursday, following US President Donald Trump’s signing of a funding bill late on Wednesday to resume federal operations. The two agencies’ respective plans require employees to come in on the “next regularly scheduled workday [...] following enactment of appropriations legislation,” which acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham appeared to confirm in a Thursday X post. Source: Caroline D. Pham Amid the government shutdown, both agencies had fewer staff and reduced operations. In the SEC’s case, this limited its ability to review applications for exchange-traded funds, including those tied to cryptocurrencies. The CFTC’s plan said it would “cease the vast bulk of its operations,” including enforcement, market oversight and work on regulatory rulemaking. With the reopening of the government, however, the SEC and CFTC may need some time to catch up on activities, such as reviewing registration applications submitted in the previous 43 days. Some companies submitted IPO and ETF applications amid reports that the shutdown would likely end soon. “I’m sure some [companies] took the position that they could just submit [an application to the SEC] knowing it’s not going to be looked at until they get back, but at least they’re in the queue,” Jay Dubow, a partner at law firm Troutman Pepper Locke, told Cointelegraph. He also warned of the possible ramifications of the SEC going through repeated shutdowns: “Every time you go through something like this, there’s the risk of things just slipping through the cracks in various ways.” Related: Last US penny minted shows why savers need Bitcoin During the shutdown, officials with both financial regulators regularly spoke at conferences on their approach to cryptocurrencies, sometimes commenting on their availability and addressing the reduced operations. “Within limits, we’re still obviously functioning,” said SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Oct. 7, less than a week into the lapse in appropriations. “There are restrictions on what we can and can’t do, especially for staff [...] I can still come and do things like this [referring to the conference].” Before the funding bill had been resolved, Akins said that the SEC planned to consider “establishing a token taxonomy” in the coming months, “anchored” in the Howey test to recognize that “investment contracts can come to an end.” Pham, similarly, said the CFTC had been pushing for approval of leveraged spot cryptocurrency trading as early as December. Prospective CFTC chair scheduled for Senate hearing Michael Selig, who serves as chief counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday as part of Trump’s push to have him confirmed as the next CFTC chair. Though the hearing could likely have moved forward amid the shutdown, Selig’s authority with the agency, had he been confirmed, would have been severely limited. Pham is expected to leave her position as acting chair should the Senate confirm Selig. However, even if he were to be installed quickly, the CFTC would still face a dearth of leadership, with only one Senate-confirmed commissioner out of the usual five.

A pre-Christmas Fed rate cut could boost spending, shift bond yields, lift risk assets and increase demand for crypto. Listen 0:00 How to COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways The Fed’s Dec. 9-10 meeting carries unusual weight as markets wait to see whether another rate cut will arrive before Christmas, shaping bonds, equities and crypto. After two cuts in 2025, rates now sit at 3.75%-4.00%. Labor weakness and softer inflation support further easing, but officials remain divided because inflation risks have not fully cleared. A cooling job market, easing inflation and the end of quantitative tightening could justify another reduction and align with year-end liquidity needs. Sticky inflation, gaps in economic data caused by the government shutdown and a divided Fed may push policymakers to keep rates unchanged this December. When the US Federal Reserve meets on Dec. 9-10 to decide on interest rates, it will not be just another routine gathering. Markets are watching closely to see what direction policymakers choose. Will the Fed cut rates again before the holidays? A pre-Christmas Eve reduction could send waves through bonds, stocks, credit markets and crypto. This article explains why the Fed’s pre-Christmas meeting is significant and outlines the factors supporting or opposing a potential rate cut. It also highlights what to watch in the coming weeks and how a Fed move could affect crypto and other financial markets. The background of a December rate cut Central banks typically cut rates when inflation is easing, economic growth slows or financial conditions become too tight. In late October, the Federal Reserve lowered rates by 25 basis points, setting the federal funds target range at 3.75%-4.00%, its lowest level since 2022. The move followed another 25-basis-point cut in September 2025, making it the Fed’s second rate reduction of the year. The move came amid clear signs of a cooling labor market. October recorded one of the worst monthly layoff totals in more than two decades, according to multiple labor-market reports , reinforcing concerns about weakening job conditions. The Fed’s October statement echoed this trend, noting that risks to employment had increased even as inflation remained somewhat elevated. At a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that a December cut is “not a foregone conclusion.” Yet economists at Goldman Sachs still expect a cut, pointing to clear signs of labor market weakness. Fed officials remain divided, with some emphasizing inflation risks and the limited room for further easing. A December rate cut is possible, but it is not guaranteed. Factors supporting a potential rate cut There are several reasons the Fed may decide to cut rates: Cooling labor market: Private sector data shows softer hiring, rising layoffs and a slight increase in unemployment. Moderating inflation: Inflation is still above target but continues to trend lower, giving the Fed more flexibility to ease policy. Ending quantitative tightening: The Fed has announced it will stop reducing the size of its balance sheet beginning Dec. 1. Pre-holiday timing: A rate cut would align with year-end liquidity needs and help set expectations for 2026. Arguments for the Fed to postpone action Several factors suggest the Fed may delay a rate cut in the near future: Sticky inflation: According to the Fed’s latest statement , the inflation rate remains “somewhat elevated.” Data vacuum: The US government shutdown has delayed key employment and inflation reports, making policy assessments more difficult. Committee division: Federal Reserve officials are split on the appropriate path forward, which encourages a more cautious approach. Limited room for easing: After multiple cuts this year, some analysts argue that policy is already close to a neutral level. Did you know? In March 2020, the Fed cut interest rates to near zero to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. It lowered rates by a total of 1.5 percentage points across its meetings on March 3 and March 15. What to monitor before December These factors are likely to shape the Fed’s upcoming policy decision on rate cuts: Nonfarm payrolls and unemployment: Is the job market continuing to slow? Inflation data: Any unexpected rise in inflation will reduce expectations for policy easing. Financial conditions and market signals: Are credit spreads widening, and is overall market liquidity tightening? Fed communications: Differences of opinion within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may influence the outcome. External shocks: Trade developments, geopolitical risks or sudden supply disruptions could shift the Fed’s approach. Did you know? US stocks have historically returned about 11% in the 12 months after the Fed begins cutting rates. How a Federal Reserve cut may impact crypto Fed rate cuts increase global liquidity and often push investors toward riskier assets like crypto in search of higher returns. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) tend to benefit from stronger risk appetite and rising institutional inflows. Lower decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing rates also encourage more leverage and trading activity. Stablecoins may see greater use in payments, although their yield advantage narrows when rates fall. However, if a rate cut is interpreted as a signal of recession, crypto may experience equity-like volatility. Markets might see an initial boost from easier liquidity, followed by a pullback driven by broader macro concerns. If global financial conditions loosen instead, the environment could support further crypto demand. Lower borrowing costs make it easier for people and institutions to take investment risks, which can draw more interest toward digital assets. As more money flows into the sector, crypto companies can build better tools and services, helping the industry connect more smoothly with the rest of the financial system. Did you know? When the Fed cuts rates, short-term bond yields usually fall first, creating opportunities for traders who track movements in the yield curve. Consequences of a Fed rate cut on other financial sectors Here is a look at the potential effects on major asset classes if the Fed cuts interest rates: Bonds and yields: Short-term yields will likely decline as markets adjust their expectations. The yield curve may steepen if long-term yields remain stabler than short-term ones, which can signal confidence in future growth. If the cut is viewed as a sign of recession risk, long-term yields may fall as well, resulting in a flattening or even an inversion of the curve. US dollar and global FX: A rate cut generally weakens the dollar because interest rate differentials narrow. This often supports emerging markets and commodity-exporting countries. If the cut is driven by concerns about economic growth, safe-haven demand may temporarily push the dollar higher. Equities: A pre-Christmas Eve rate cut could spark a rally in US stocks if investors see it as a sign of confidence in a soft landing. A soft landing refers to cooling inflation alongside a stable labor market. If the cut is motivated by growth worries instead, corporate earnings may come under pressure, and defensive sectors could outperform cyclical ones.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Singapore’s central bank has signaled a forthcoming shakeout of unregulated stablecoins as the country moves to protect the integrity of assets within its financial ecosystem. In a keynote speech at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Thursday, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Managing Director Chia Der Jiun warned that “unregulated stablecoins have a patchy record of keeping their peg.” “There has been a lot of attention on stablecoins. They are offered as open platforms, able to work across many different applications and use cases,” Chia said. “While agility is a strength, stability needs to be reinforced.” Chia compared depeggings to the money-market fund runs of 2008, and said that unregulated stablecoins are “not suitable as safe settlement assets for large wholesale transactions.” This signals that Singapore intends to draw a clear distinction between fully regulated tokens and all other stablecoins. Digital money requires stability Chia said that the next phase of digital money requires not just speed and programmability but also stability. While stablecoins are promoted as open, composable platforms that move across applications and borders, he said this needs to be matched with credible backing and redemption rights. He said that without the foundation, confidence can quickly unravel, especially if weakly regulated issuers trigger broader loss of trust across the sector. Chia said MAS is preparing legislation for its stablecoin framework, finalized earlier this year. On Aug. 15, MAS released a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring stability for single-currency stablecoins. He said the regime considers reserve backing and redemption reliability as the main requirements for eligibility. This signals that only well-capitalized and fully supervised issuers will be recognized as settlement-grade assets. Chia added that the rules are subject to change as stablecoins become more integrated into the financial sector. “Over time, if some regulated stablecoins become systemic, regulatory frameworks will need to be strengthened further, cross-border regulatory cooperation enhanced, and access to central bank facilities considered,” Chia said. Related: Coinbase Business launches in Singapore to reshape payments with USDC CBDCs and tokenized bank money In addition to stablecoins, Chia also discussed the central bank’s vision for other settlement assets, including wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) and tokenized bank liabilities. Chia said that MAS’s Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multicurrency (BLOOM) initiative is testing how these instruments can operate within a broader tokenized financial system. “MAS is working with industry partners to explore the use of all three settlement assets,” he said. He encouraged financial institutions and clearing and settlement networks to conduct trials under the initiative.

Since the second quarter, the university has doubled its position in the Bitcoin ETF, adding 487,636 shares valued at about $25 million.

While the original GBTC ETF charges a 1.5% annual management fee, the Mini Trust ETF is positioned as Grayscale’s “lowest-cost spot Bitcoin fund” with a fee of 0.15%. The fund was launched through an initial seeding process, involving the distribution of 10% of GBTC’s underlying Bitcoin.

The Nasdaq Stock Market exchange on Wednesday officially notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it has received the Form 8‑A filing for the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC). “The official listing notice for XRPC has arrived from Nasdaq,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X, adding: “Looks like tomorrow is on for the launch.” While ETF watchers expect Canary’s spot XRP ( XRP ) ETF to debut trading on Thursday, the SEC has yet to issue its final approval for trading to commence, leaving the debut uncertain heading into the market open. The sixth single crypto asset ETF Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, took to X on Thursday to report that Canary had launched its website for the Canary XRP ETF, highlighting the likely soon-to-come trading launch. “Canary Capital will be first to market,” Geraci said , adding that its XRP ETF would be the sixth single crypto asset in the ETF wrapper after Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Hedera ( HBAR ).

Canary’s highly anticipated XRP ETF launch comes after weeks of speculation, with ETF experts such as Geraci predicting its debut two weeks ago . The potential launch follows closely on the heels of US President Donald Trump signing a bill on Wednesday to officially end the longest government shutdown in history. While Bitcoin and Ether ETFs each began trading the day after their respective SEC approvals, newer ETFs such as Solana, Litecoin and Hedera launched the next day after their exchange listings under the regulator’s newly adopted procedures . With trading going live on Oct. 28, some ETF observers have suggested that these new crypto funds relied on “automatic effectiveness” provisions during the government shutdown.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update Nov. 13, 9:20 am UTC: This article has been updated to include an official statement from Metaplanet. Japan’s largest stock-exchange operator weighs new restrictions on publicly listed companies that pivot their core business into buying and holding crypto, signaling a potential shift in one of the most active markets for digital-asset treasury (DAT) firms. Citing anonymous sources familiar with internal deliberations, Bloomberg reported that Japan Exchange Group (JPX) is exploring stricter scrutiny for companies that shift their core business into large-scale crypto accumulation. This includes adding fresh audit requirements and applying backdoor-listing rules to such companies. The move comes after a wave of losses hit Japan’s DATs, many of which attracted retail investors earlier this year. Metaplanet, Japan’s largest DAT, holding over 30,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ), saw its shares fall from a year-to-date ( YTD ) high of $15.35 on May 21 to $2.66 at the time of writing. This marked an 82% drop from its highest value this year. Japanese nail salon franchiser Convano, which saw a breakout performance in August , now trades at about $0.79 per share, a 61% drop from its high of $2.05 on Aug. 21. BitcoinTreasuries.NET data showed that the company is down nearly 11% on its BTC investment. Metaplanet’s six-month price chart. Source: Google Finance Backdoor listing rules would fill a regulatory gap Applying backdoor listing rules to companies pivoting into crypto accumulation would mark a significant tightening of Japan’s listing standards. Backdoor listings occur when a private company acquires an already listed shell company to bypass the traditional initial public offering (IPO) route, and JPX already prohibits such maneuvers. Extending the prohibition to listed firms that shift into crypto-holding vehicles would close a regulatory gap that some DATs may have exploited to evolve their business models. If JPX formally restricts such pivots, it could slow or halt the listing pipeline for new DATs. Related: Strategy’s Bitcoin dominance slips in October as corporate treasuries expand Metaplanet boss highlights governance steps in response to JPX report Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich pushed back against the implication that Bitcoin-accumulating firms may have sidestepped governance or disclosure rules. In an X post, Gerovich responded to the report, saying that JPX’s concerns are directed at companies suspected of conducting backdoor listings or pivoting into digital assets without proper shareholder approvals. He said this does not apply to Metaplanet. “In contrast, at Metaplanet we have held five shareholder meetings over the past two years (four extraordinary general meetings and one annual meeting), securing shareholder approval for all critical matters.” He added that they also amended the company’s articles of incorporation and increased authorized shares to fund BTC purchases. He said that the company adhered to formal governance processes under the same management team that had led the company prior to the pivot. Metaplanet also released an official statement following the Bloomberg report, echoing Gerovich’s post and saying that it had not been subject to any regulatory inquiries or requests. The company said that it’s prepared to engage in “constructive dialogue” with authorities to contribute to discussions on establishing proper regulatory frameworks.

In prepared remarks for a speech on Wednesday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Atkins provided details about the agency’s plans to modernize its approach to regulating digital assets. According to Atkins, the agency plans to consider “establishing a token taxonomy” in the coming months, “anchored” in the Howey test — the standard by which the SEC evaluates securities — to recognize that “investment contracts can come to an end.” “Commissioner [Hester] Peirce has rightly observed that while a project’s token launch might initially involve an investment contract, those promises may not remain forever,” Atkins said, adding that “once the investment contract can be understood to have run its course, the token may continue to trade, but those trades are no longer ‘securities transactions.’” Atkins said that while he led the agency, he would consider digital commodities, digital collectibles, digital tools, and network tokens not securities under its purview. “Tokenized securities,” in contrast, would continue to be regulated by the SEC.

While the SEC protects investors from securities fraud, the federal government has a host of other regulatory bodies well equipped to police and protect against illicit conduct.” Market structure bill moving forward despite government shutdown Although the US government remains shut down as of Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers in the House of Representatives are expected to vote on a funding bill this evening, which has already been passed by the Senate.

The GENIUS Act established clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. “As clarity emerges, yield-bearing stablecoins are exploding: market capitalization is up 300% YoY, with new protocols launching monthly to capture the opportunity.” RWAs, which are tokenized versions of traditional assets such as bonds or funds, are also introducing new sources of passive income as major institutions recognize the efficiency of onchain settlement.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japan’s first domestic stablecoin issuer said digital asset companies may soon become significant players in the country’s sovereign debt market, potentially reshaping monetary policy. JPYC, the Tokyo-based company behind Japan’s first yen-pegged stablecoin, said issuers may evolve into major buyers of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) as their reserves increase. In comments reported by Reuters, JPYC founder and CEO Noritaka Okabe said stablecoin reserves could fill the gap left by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) as it slows its bond purchases. The Tokyo-based startup started issuing its yen-backed token , also dubbed JPYC, on Oct. 27, under the country’s revised Payment Services Act, its first legal framework for stablecoins. The company has issued about $930,000 worth of tokens to date and aims to reach a circulation of $66 billion within the next three years. The token is backed by a combination of bank deposits and JGBs and is fully convertible to yen. It’s also designed to move seamlessly across blockchain rails. Stablecoin issuers as new bond buyers Okabe said JPYC plans to invest 80% of its issuance proceeds in JGBs and keep the remaining 20% in bank savings, initially focusing on short-term securities. He added that the company may consider longer-term JGBs in the future as demand grows and the yields remain attractive. This type of allocation could give stablecoin issuers a significant role in Japan’s debt market, where the BOJ still holds about half of the $7 trillion JGB market. As the central bank slows bond purchases, new buyers need to absorb the issuance. Because of this, Okabe floated the idea that stablecoin reserves could naturally fill part of the vacuum, linking blockchain adoption to fiscal financing. “The volumes of JGBs stablecoin issuers buy will be swayed by the balance of supply and demand for stablecoins,” he said, noting that this trend “will happen around the world” and that Japan will not be an exception. Related: Visa pilots fiat-funded stablecoin payouts for US businesses Stablecoin adoption in Japan Okabe’s comments came as stablecoins continue to see adoption in Japan’s traditional finance sector. On Friday, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s financial regulator, endorsed a yen-pegged stablecoin project led by Japan’s biggest financial institutions. The FSA announced the “Payment Innovation Project,” an initiative that involves Mizuho Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and its financial arm and Progmat, MUFG’s stablecoin issuance platform. The regulator said that the companies will begin issuing payment stablecoins this month.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED JPMorgan Chase & Co. — the world’s biggest bank by market capitalization — has begun deploying a token representing deposits held at the bank, called JPM Coin. According to a Wednesday Bloomberg report , JPMorgan’s institutional clients now have access to the JPM Coin. The bank’s blockchain division co-lead, Naveen Mallela, told Bloomberg that the token represents US dollar deposits at the bank and allows users to send and receive money on the blockchain created by US crypto exchange Coinbase, called Base, a platform endorsed by the bank . In mid-June, Mallela announced that a fixed number of JPMD tokens would be transferred to Coinbase on Base in the following days. The transfer was part of a pilot phase that was followed by allowing Coinbase’s institutional clients to access the bank’s deposit token. Still, a spokesperson for the bank told Cointelegraph that the institution plans to add support for more public blockchains in the future. JPM Coin enables instant, 24/7 payment processing, which is significantly faster than the typical times seen in the US banking system. The news follows this week’s announcement by JPMorgan and Singapore multinational banking group DBS that they are developing a blockchain-based tokenization framework to enable onchain transfers between their deposit token ecosystems. A JPMorgan spokesperson said the initiative aims “to enable the seamless exchangeability and settlement of tokenized deposits across both public and permissioned blockchains, to set a new standard for the industry. The representative also told Cointelegraph that “it can be transferred for peer-to-peer payments among approved listed entities” and that “there are no plans to offer JPM Coin to retail clients at this time.“ The bank’s spokesperson noted that JPMorgan plans to issue JPM Coin in other currency denominations in addition to the US dollar. The firm also “already trademarked JPME for EUR-denominated deposit tokens.” The JPMorgan Chase building.

This is the primary distinction between this type of token and traditional stablecoins , which are issued by a private entity and backed by assets to maintain their value. Much like the broader US financial industry, JPMorgan appears to be doubling down on its commitment to tokenization and blockchain technology. At the end of October, JPMorgan’s private bank and asset management divisions initiated the first transaction on the forthcoming Kinexys Fund Flow fund tokenization platform.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US government is moving closer to reopening after more than 40 days of being shut down, following several Democratic lawmakers in the Senate siding with Republicans to pass a funding bill. On Monday, the US Senate held a late-night vote for a bill “continuing appropriations and extensions for fiscal year 2026,” which passed 60 to 40 in the chamber. The bill is expected to fund the government through Jan. 31, 2026, provided it passes in the House of Representatives and is signed into law by President Donald Trump. As Tuesday is a US federal holiday, the House is not expected to reconvene to vote on the bill until Wednesday at the earliest. Prediction platform Polymarket has already adjusted its expectation that the US government will return to normal operations on Friday, likely following the passage of the House bill. Source: Polymarket Amid the government shutdown — the longest in the country’s history — many federal agencies have furloughed staff and reduced operations to align with the lack of funding. Even if the bill were to immediately pass and be signed into law, it will likely take some time before staff can return to work. The operations plan at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, will allow employees to come back on the “next regularly scheduled workday following enactment of appropriations legislation.” Related: China raises alarm over alleged US role in one of the largest Bitcoin hacks Digital asset market structure negotiations proceeding On Monday, the leadership of the Senate Agriculture Committee released a discussion draft of a comprehensive bill on crypto market structure. The draft followed weeks of reported negotiations between Democratic and Republican lawmakers, about four months after the House passed its version of the legislation. The shutdown likely helped slow progress on the bill, which Republican leaders initially expected to be out of the Agriculture Committee and Banking Committee by the end of October and signed into law by 2026. Though Republicans still have a path forward to enact the legislation, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis warned that pushing the passage beyond January or February could make the bill vulnerable amid the 2026 midterm campaigns.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Leading financial institutions are continuing to explore blockchain technology to facilitate cheaper and faster institutional payments, signaling a growing interest in tokenization solutions. US investment bank JPMorgan and Singapore multinational banking group DBS announced Tuesday that they are developing a blockchain-based tokenization framework to enable onchain transfers between their deposit token ecosystems. The effort aims to set a new industry standard for cross-bank digital payments. The tokenization framework will allow the two financial institutions to facilitate instant payments around the clock, across both public and permissioned blockchain networks, providing their institutional clients with broader access to cross-bank onchain transactions. According to DBS, the new framework will allow institutional clients of both banks to exchange or redeem tokenized deposits and conduct real-time cross-border payments on both public and permissioned blockchain networks. The system is designed to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing what DBS called “round-the-clock availability.” The new interoperability framework comes amid a period of growing institutional interest in tokenized financial solutions, which are part of the broader tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector, aiming to bring financial and tangible assets on the blockchain to increase investor access. At least one-third of surveyed commercial banks have launched, piloted, or researched tokenized deposits, according to a 2024 survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Financial institutions are exploring tokenized deposits.

The bill aims to outline the limits of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s power to regulate crypto. Only Congress can set the agencies’ regulatory boundaries, and both have shared guidance to companies about crypto under the Trump administration’s deregulation push. “The CFTC is the right agency to regulate spot digital commodity trading, and it is essential to establish clear rules for the emerging crypto market while also protecting consumers,” Boozman said. Booker said the discussion draft “would provide the CFTC with new authority to regulate the digital commodity spot market, create new protections for retail customers, and ensure the agency has the personnel and resources necessary to oversee this growing market.” Parts of crypto bill still up for change The draft bill outlines common crypto terms such as “blockchain,” “decentralized finance,” and decentralized autonomous organizations and how they would be regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Acting Chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Caroline Pham is in talks with regulated US crypto exchanges to launch leveraged spot crypto products as early as next month. In a Sunday X post , Pham confirmed that she is pushing to allow leveraged spot crypto trading in the US and that she is in talks with regulated US crypto exchanges to launch leveraged crypto spot products next month. Pham also confirmed that she continued meeting with industry representatives despite the government shutdown. The regulator is also currently considering issuing guidance for leveraged spot crypto products. The news comes after the CFTC launched an initiative in early August to enable the trading of “spot crypto asset contracts” on exchanges registered with the regulator. In an announcement at the time, Pham invited comment on the rules that governed “retail trading of commodities with leverage, margin, or financing.” According to the Federal Register , the Commodity Exchange Act “provides that a retail commodity transaction entered into with a retail person which is executed on a leveraged or margined basis” is “subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction, unless the transaction results in actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days of the transaction.” Consequently, leveraged crypto spot positions would only be allowed if their duration were limited to 28 days or they would be illegal.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United Kingdom’s central bank is moving toward stablecoin regulation by publishing a consultation paper proposing a regulatory framework for the asset class. The Bank of England (BoE) on Monday released a proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated “systemic stablecoins,” or tokens it said are widely used in payments and therefore potentially pose risks to the UK financial stability. Under the proposal, the central bank would require stablecoin issuers to back at least 40% of their liabilities with unremunerated deposits at the BoE, while allowing up to 60% in short-term UK government debt. The consultation paper seeks feedback on the proposed regime until Feb. 10, 2026, with the BoE planning to finalize the regulations in the second half of the year. Holding limits, backing and oversight As part of the proposal, the central bank suggested capping individual stablecoin holdings at 20,000 British pounds ($26,300) per token, while allowing exemptions from the proposed 10,000 pound ($13,200) for retail businesses. “We propose that issuers implement per-coin holding limits of 20,000 GBP for individuals and 10 million pounds for businesses,” the BoE stated, adding that businesses could qualify for exemptions if higher balances are needed in the course of normal operations.

Chanos said that shares in Strategy are down about 50% from their 2025 high and that the company’s market Net Asset Value (mNAV) has compressed to 1.23x. “It is prudent to cover this trade with mNAV below 1.25x, having dropped from ~2.0x as recently as July 2025,” Chanos wrote in a note.

This regulatory apparatus for stablecoins establishes a level of legitimacy and accountability congruent with holding traditional dollar assets,” he said, adding: “For the purposes of monetary policy, the most important aspect of the GENIUS Act is that it requires U.S.-domiciled issuers to maintain reserves backed on at least a one-to-one basis in safe and liquid US dollar–denominated assets.” Magazine: Bitcoin’s ‘speed bump’ to $56K?

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Federal Reserve’s decision to ease monetary policy is inflating an economic bubble that could drive up the prices of hard assets, but also marks the final phase of a 75-year economic cycle, according to former hedge fund manager Ray Dalio. Typically, the Federal Reserve eases interest rates when economic activity is stagnating or declining, asset prices are falling, unemployment is high and credit dries up, as seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s or the 2008 financial crisis, Dalio wrote in an article posted to X on Wednesday . However, the Fed is now easing monetary policy at a time of low unemployment, economic growth and rising asset markets, Dalio wrote, which is typical of late-stage economies saddled with too much debt. Monetary stimulus is typically injected during times of falling inflation and lower asset prices. Source: Ray Dalio This “dangerous” combination is more inflationary, Dalio wrote, warning investors to keep an eye on upcoming fiscal and monetary decisions. “Because the fiscal side of government policy is now highly stimulative, due to huge existing debt outstanding and huge deficits financed with huge Treasury issuance — especially in relatively short maturities — quantitative easing would effectively monetize government debt rather than simply re-liquify the private system.” The continued inflationary pressure and currency debasement are positive catalysts for Bitcoin ( BTC ), gold and other store-of-value assets, which are seen as hedges against macroeconomic and geopolitical risks , including a reset of the global monetary order .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Department of the Treasury is facing conflicting feedback from crypto companies and traditional banking groups over how to implement the GENIUS Act, the law that regulates stablecoin payments in the US. In a letter on Tuesday, Coinbase urged the Treasury to limit a ban on stablecoin interest payments exclusively to stablecoin issuers, while allowing it for non-issuers, such as crypto exchanges. Coinbase said its proposal aligns with Congress’s intent when passing the legislation. At the same time, several banking groups, led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), have pressed the Treasury to extend the prohibition to non-issuers, advocating for a blanket ban on stablecoin interest payments. The recommendations were submitted in response to the Treasury’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), marking the second round of public comments on the implementation of the GENIUS Act, which concluded on Tuesday. BPI is a known opponent In a joint announcement on Wednesday, BPI and several banking groups said they urged the Treasury to extend the ban on stablecoin interest payments to digital asset service providers, including exchanges and affiliates. “Implement the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on the payment of interest or yield on payment stablecoins [...] whether paid directly by an issuer or indirectly by an issuer’s affiliates or partners,” BPI said in a separate statement on Tuesday. An excerpt from the ANPR response by BPI-led banking associations. Source: BPI The same group previously opposed the same issue in August, arguing that stablecoin interest payments may potentially trigger $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system. “Treasury has no authority to second-guess Congress’s work” According to Coinbase, Treasury has to follow the congressional intent in implementing the GENIUS Act, including preserving the right of non-issuers to offer interest on stablecoin holdings. “Congress went no further,” Coinbase said, adding: “It declined to include non-issuer third parties within that prohibition because banning other types of payments on stablecoins across the board would have inhibited growth and innovation of the stablecoin market — contrary to the GENIUS Act’s core purposes.” The exchange concluded: “Treasury has no authority to second-guess Congress’s work.” In addition to advocating for stablecoin yields, Coinbase called for excluding non-financial software, blockchain validators and open-source protocols from the GENIUS Act. It also recommended treating payment stablecoins as cash equivalents for tax and accounting purposes. Signed into law in July , the GENIUS Act is expected to take effect either 18 months after enactment or 120 days after relevant federal regulators issue final implementing regulations, likely landing in late 2026 or January 2027.

According to a Tuesday Politico report, Republican Senator John Boozman of the Senate Agriculture Committee — one of the committees that will need to approve the bill before consideration in the full chamber — will discuss the market structure legislation with White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks and Democratic Senator Cory Booker. The call will come as lawmakers prepare to finalize a discussion draft of the bill. The market structure bill is expected to be one of the most significant pieces of cryptocurrency legislation to emerge from the current session of Congress. Initially passed by the House of Representatives in July, many had expected the bill to pass in the Senate with bipartisan support . However, discussions were complicated by Democrats’ insistence on provisions for decentralized finance protocols and the US government shutdown, which entered its 36th day on Wednesday. It’s unclear whether Senate lawmakers intend to prioritize any crypto legislation ahead of a funding bill to reopen the government and return financial agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to full staff and operations. However, after a few high-profile Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections, some senators, including Chris Murphy, have suggested holding the line to push Republican lawmakers to support extending healthcare subsidies and reverse cuts from a July funding bill.

The company said it combines treasury operations, research and wallet infrastructure to help institutions manage and account for Bitcoin exposure within traditional corporate structures. “This round brings together leading venture investors who share our conviction in Bitcoin and in the strength of the team we have built at Future,” Future CEO Sebastien Hess said in the release, adding that the commitment reflects confidence in the vision to build a premier Bitcoin treasury company in Europe. Future blends traditional finance and Bitcoin-native leadership Future’s co-founders include Marc Syz, the CEO of Syz Capital; Julian Liniger, the CEO of Switzerland-based Bitcoin-only investment app Relai, and Adam Back, the inventor of Hashcash and CEO of Blockstream. Future is led by traditional finance and Bitcoin-native executives. Its chairman, Richard Byworth, is the managing partner at Switzerland-based private investment firm Syz Capital, and Hess is a fintech and Bitcoin entrepreneur who worked at Block Green, a project backed by Peter Thiel and Coinbase. Its backers, Fulgur Ventures and Tobam, bring further credibility to the company.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The White House carefully considered Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s pardon and went through the standard processes before sending it to President Donald Trump for his approval, says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump defended the pardon in an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes on Sunday , saying he had “no idea” who Zhao is and dismissing criticism of his pardon as politically motivated. Leavitt said in a briefing on Tuesday that Trump’s comments on Zhao in the interview were meant to convey that “he does not know him personally” and that the president “does not have a personal relationship with this individual.” She added that the pardon was considered with “utmost seriousness” and went through a “thorough review process” by the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel’s office. “There’s a whole team of qualified lawyers who look at every single pardon request that ultimately make their way up to the president of the United States,” she added. “He’s the ultimate final decision maker.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed reporters about Zhao’s pardon in a briefing on Tuesday. Source: YouTube It follows multiple news reports suggesting Binance helped the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, with building its stablecoin and using it in a $2 billion investment deal, which Binance CEO Richard Teng has denied . Trump “corrected” a wrong, Leavitt says Leavitt claimed that Zhao was “over-prosecuted by a weaponized DOJ,” and the Biden administration sought an excessive penalty as a result. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti–Money Laundering program at Binance in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. US prosecutors initially requested a three-year prison term, but the sentencing judge rejected that as “too harsh ” and instead opted for a four-month jail sentence, which Zhao began serving in April 2024. “The president is correcting that wrong, and he has officially ended the Biden administration’s war on the cryptocurrency industry, and I think that’s the message he sent with this pardon,” Leavitt said. Zhao’s lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillén, and other supporters have argued it was a harsh sentence given that it was a single charge of failure to have an effective compliance program, and Zhao was a non-violent first-time offender. 60 Minutes cut question on crypto from show In a section of Trump’s 60 Minutes interview that was cut from broadcast, CBS’s Norah O’Donnell asked the president whether he was concerned “about the appearance of corruption,” regarding Zhao’s pardon.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Commission’s plan to expand the authority of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) over cryptocurrency and capital markets has sparked debate across Europe, with critics warning it could stifle innovation and slow decision-making. The European Union is reportedly exploring giving the ESMA direct supervisory powers over stock exchanges and crypto service providers, potentially creating a centralized regulatory framework similar to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC ). The European Commission is expected to publish a draft of the plan in December. Under the existing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took effect for crypto asset service providers in December 2024, companies authorized in one EU member state can “passport” their licenses to operate across the 27-nation bloc. Industry warns against innovation slowdown However, granting control to the ESMA risks slowing down innovation, particularly among crypto and financial technology (fintech) companies, according to Faustine Fleuret, head of public affairs at decentralized lending protocol Morpho. “Centralizing authorization and supervision entirely within ESMA would demand vast human and financial resources, she told Cointelegraph. “[ESMA supervision] would likely slow down decision-making and innovation, particularly for newer players in crypto and fintech companies who rely on close collaboration with their domestic regulators.” Fleuret said a more balanced approach would involve giving ESMA stronger oversight powers over national regulators, such as the ability to suspend or revoke licenses, rather than centralizing all decision-making in Brussels. Related: Bitcoin’ money vessel’ amasses $8B but recovery lacks ETF inflows In September, France’s securities regulator threatened to ban the “passporting” of crypto licenses under the MiCA regime, raising concerns about enforcement gaps in the EU-wide regulatory framework. “The EU passport is the cornerstone of EU financial regulations, including MiCA; jeopardising it means depriving crypto market players of the only competitive advantage that Europe currently offers them,” said Fleuret. Related: Coinbase mulls $2B BVNK startup acquisition in stablecoin push: Report Experts call for balanced supervision Other policy experts see the Paris-based ESMA’s expanding jurisdiction as a promising sign for crypto regulatory maturity in the EU. Centralizing control and standards across EU member states could help with the most pressing concerns related to MiCA, including licensing, cybersecurity and custodial risks, according to Dea Markova, director of policy at digital asset custody platform Fireblocks. “At a principal level, we believe that more standard-setting and guidance is needed to address risks stemming from operational resilience of the custody function,” Markova told Cointelegraph. “We can extrapolate from this specific risk that other areas of MiCA and DORA [Digital Operational Resilience Act] can benefit from supervisory convergence, be it through more guidance or through creating a single EU supervisor.” Markova cautioned that the success of centralized supervision will depend on how the plan is implemented and resourced. The idea of creating a single supervisory body, similar to the SEC, was also backed by European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde, who voiced support for the concept during the European Banking Congress in November 2023.

Warren’s lawyer Ben Stafford said in a letter to Goody Guillén on Sunday obtained by Punchbowl News that “any threatened defamation claim would be without merit,” as the law Zhao “pled guilty to violating is an anti-money laundering law.” Warren said in her X post that Zhao “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison,” which Zhao rebuffed online days later , saying “there were NO money laundering [charges].“ Statement needs “actual malice,” lawyer argues Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, and a Seattle federal court sentenced him to four months in prison in April 2024. Warren’s X post added that Zhao “financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon,” adding to criticism of Trump’s pardon due to ties between Binance and his family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Warren’s X post was given a so-called “community note,” a crowdsourced comment outlining Zhao’s guilty plea. Source: Elizabeth Warren The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have reported that Binance helped create World Liberty’s stablecoin USD1. The stablecoin was also used in a $2 billion deal for the Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX to buy a stake in Binance in March. Politico reported on Oct. 25 that Zhao’s pardon came after Binance and its legal team undertook an expensive, months-long effort to win over key figures in Trump’s orbit. Stafford, Warren’s lawyer, argued in the letter that Warren’s X post “is true in all respects and therefore cannot be defamatory,” and it “accurately represented publicly available and widely reported facts.” “A public figure such as Mr. Zhao cannot prevail on a defamation claim without presenting evidence that the defendant published a false statement of fact with actual malice,” he added. Zhao’s lawyer asks for retraction Zhao’s lawyer, Goody Guillén, said in the letter seen by the New York Post that he “will not remain silent while a United States Senator seemingly misuses the office to repeatedly publish defamatory statements that impugn his reputation.” Related: Trump’s crypto pardons raise ethics and corruption concerns The letter asked Warren to retract statements in both her post on X and a Senate resolution seeking to denounce Trump’s pardon of Zhao, or Zhao could “pursue all legal remedies available to address these false statements.” Stafford argued that Warren’s X post “simply references the fact that Mr. Zhao pled guilty to a violation of U.S. anti-money laundering law.” “Her X Post does not state — and should not be construed to state — that he pled guilty to any other money laundering charge,” the letter added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Commission is exploring plans to bring stock and cryptocurrency exchanges under central supervision as part of a broader effort to make the bloc’s capital markets more competitive with those in the US. The incoming proposal would expand the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) jurisdiction to include stock and crypto exchanges, as well as crypto asset service providers and other trading infrastructure, the Financial Times reported on Saturday. The EU's current landscape comprises numerous national and regional regulatory agencies, which significantly raises the cost of cross-border trade, hindering startup development in the region. Empowering a single supervisory body akin to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be the next step for the EU's “capital markets union,” which is also backed by European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde. “Creating a European SEC, for example, by extending the powers of ESMA, could be the answer. It would need a broad mandate, including direct supervision, to mitigate systemic risks posed by large cross-border firms,” Lagarde said at the European Banking Congress in November 2023.

In September, France's securities regulator threatened to ban crypto license “passporting” under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regime, raising concerns about enforcement gaps in the EU-wide regulatory framework. France also became the third country to call for the Paris-based ESMA to take over supervision of major crypto companies, after Austria and Italy. Under MiCA, which took effect for crypto-asset service providers in December 2024, companies authorized in one member state can use that license as a “passport” to operate across the 27-nation bloc.

In a Friday judgment in the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, three circuit judges affirmed a lower court ruling in the District of Wyoming. The appeal, filed in April 2024 after the court ruled against granting Custodia a US Federal Reserve master account, was the latest setback since the crypto-friendly bank first submitted its application in October 2020. “This case comes clothed in 21st Century terms: cryptocurrency, digital assets, instant wire transfers, and master accounts,” said the Friday judgment. “But there is nothing new about this issue. Courts have probed the legality of our nation’s central bank and interpreted the relevant statutes since the founding.” Source: Courtlistener Being approved for a Fed master account would have granted Custodia access to the payments network used by the US government and authorized financial institutions. After Custodia initially requested access through the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Fed rejected the bank’s application in 2023 for risks that were likely to be “inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices” due to its focus on digital assets.

Listen 0:00 Newsletter COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The race to develop stablecoin infrastructure is heating up across Wall Street and corporate America. Citigroup is moving ahead with plans to expand its stablecoin payment capabilities, amid growing speculation that major financial institutions are exploring stablecoin initiatives following the passage of the US GENIUS Act — comprehensive legislation expected to take effect in early 2027. The momentum extends beyond banks. Western Union announced plans to build a stablecoin payment network on Solana, underscoring how traditional payment providers are embracing blockchain for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with smaller operators rapidly closing the gap on industry leaders. And in digital lending, Ledn reported more than $1 billion in Bitcoin-backed loan originations this year — evidence that investors are increasingly opting to borrow against their BTC holdings rather than sell. Citi partners with Coinbase on stablecoin payments Citigroup is eyeing stablecoin payments as its next major growth driver, partnering with crypto exchange Coinbase to expand its digital asset capabilities. The initiative initially focuses on making it easier for clients to move between crypto and fiat currencies. Debopama Sen, Citi’s head of payments, said the move reflects growing client demand for faster, more programmable payment options. The bank is “exploring solutions to enable onchain stablecoin payments for our clients,” Sen said. The announcement comes roughly a month after Citi projected that the stablecoin market could surge to $4 trillion by 2030 , up from about $315 billion today. Following the passage of the US GENIUS Act , several major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, are reportedly exploring their own stablecoin initiatives. Stablecoins have quickly surpassed $300 billion in circulating value.

During its third-quarter earnings call, Western Union announced plans to launch an ecosystem that includes a US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) and a Digital Asset Network, developed in partnership with Anchorage Digital Bank , a federally chartered crypto bank that provides custody and infrastructure services. USDPT is expected to debut in the first half of 2026, with partnerships across several crypto exchanges to enhance accessibility and liquidity. “We looked at alternatives, and came to the conclusion that Solana was the right choice,” Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan said at the Money 20/20 USA conference. Mid-tier Bitcoin miners gain ground in post-halving shakeup The Bitcoin mining industry is growing increasingly competitive in the post-halving era, as a new wave of mid-tier companies rapidly gains market share and challenges established leaders. According to data from The Miner Mag, smaller publicly listed miners, including Cipher Mining, Bitdeer and HIVE Digital, have significantly boosted their realized hashrate after years of heavy infrastructure investment. These companies are now narrowing the gap with top players such as MARA Holdings, CleanSpark and Cango. “Their ascent highlights how the middle tier of public miners — once trailing far behind — has rapidly scaled production since the 2024 halving,” The Miner Mag wrote in a recent newsletter. Some of these companies, notably HIVE Digital , are also diversifying beyond Bitcoin mining into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing workloads — signaling a broader strategic shift within the industry.

Abu Dhabi: Tokenization goes live as UAE sets the pace More than 300 leaders from traditional finance, digital assets and regulators described a pragmatic turn toward regulated, data-rich tokenization. Listen 0:00 15650 Recap Sponsored Content Over two days in Abu Dhabi, more than 300 executives from traditional finance, the digital assets space and regulation gathered for Agentic . to map near-term deployment of tokenized finance. Held at the Four Seasons on Oct. 21 and 22, the program focused on infrastructure, data and regulation required to scale tokenized markets. Panels centered on market infrastructure rather than speculative tokens, exploring the foundations, rails, standards and verified data that make real-world assets not just viable, but inevitable. Speakers pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a fast-moving jurisdiction. Abu Dhabi features deep capital pools, increasingly formalized digital-asset frameworks and a growing presence from global financial firms. With global financial heavyweights now opening regional offices, the UAE has become a living case study in how to modernize finance without losing control. Agentic. was conducted under the Chatham House Rules, meaning the specifics of panels or attributions can’t be disclosed. Still, a recap of the broader trends and discourse can be. Tokenization moves to deployment The core message of the event was that tokenization is moving from pilots to production. Institutions are now deploying tokenized assets, and the discussion has shifted from whether to how. Discussion centered onchain selection, compliance standards and legacy-system integration. A recurring theme was the tension between blockchain ideology and regulatory reality. One project introduced a “Know Your Validator” model where every node operator is verified and accountable. It runs counter to crypto’s early ideals of anonymity, but institutional capital doesn’t care about ideology; it cares about compliance. Where clarity lives: The UAE model While the US and Europe wrestle with fragmented regulation, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has quietly built the playbook. VARA’s framework aims to enable collaboration between TradFi and DeFi. Its recognition of tokenized real-world assets provides legal clarity. The results are tangible. The Dubai Land Department fully funded a tokenized property in a single day. MANTRA secured a DeFi VASP license from VARA . Speakers characterized the approach as principle-based and execution-oriented. Abu Dhabi Global Market’s (ADGM) FSRA shares the same ethos, creating a regional corridor for capital, technology and talent. The next bottleneck: data While regulation is advancing, data remains a constraint. Nearly 70% of enterprise data at major institutions remains unstructured, fragmented or locked in incompatible systems. During the summit, Inveniam announced its acquisition of decentralized cloud provider Storj. The move brings decentralized storage into Inveniam’s fold, powering Diol — a new marketplace for data, compute and storage. Inveniam positioned Diol as merging cloud infrastructure with blockchain incentives, enabling asset owners to tokenize, monetize and retain custody of their data — even renting out compute resources for AI workflows. This past week at the Agentic Summit in Abu Dhabi, a gathering of global innovators, policymakers, and market builders, Inveniam and our partners announced key advancements that redefine how trust, data, and liquidity will power the next generation of digital markets. 1️⃣… pic.twitter.com/B8HS5zKPoF — Inveniam (@InveniamIO) October 28, 2025 One panelist described the combination as the ‘holy trinity’ of decentralized data, compute and storage, thereby forming the backbone of an AI-driven, tokenized economy. The rise of agentic AI Agentic AI was a recurring theme throughout the event. The term refers to autonomous systems that can analyze and take defined actions. Inveniam demonstrated an AI agent capable of reading private credit agreements, structuring data onchain and verifying compliance in real time. When asked whether a borrower met covenant terms, it answered instantly, all backed by credentialed data. Speakers described the use case as ‘agentic surveillance’ — programmable compliance intended to reduce manual steps. For when data is structured, verified and continuously monitored, AI replaces entire layers of analysis, monitoring and audit. The end of blockchain wars “Arguing about which chain to use is a lost discussion,” one attendee remarked, with the room in agreement. The new consensus is multichain pragmatism. Developers and institutions will use whatever infrastructure best fits their needs. Fresh news from #Agenticsummit In partnership with @InveniamIO , we are excited to announce Inveniam Chain - a purpose-built Layer 2 blockchain for managing and utilizing private real estate assets.

Meanwhile, Inveniam’s new layer 2 for private real estate is now live on MANTRA’s testnet . Speakers also emphasized liquidity, compliance and interoperability as building blocks for institutional participation. Where capital meets code Another theme was the corridor emerging between the UAE and the US. Speakers framed the UAE as offering capital and regulatory speed, and the US as contributing technology depth and market reach. Together, they’re deploying institutional-grade infrastructure at a pace few regions can match. Across the two days, investors and builders echoed the same sentiment: while they could and can build elsewhere, the UAE is where innovation, clarity and capital converge. The next chapter Agentic. wasn’t about looking back, it was about asset managers, allocators, regulators and technologists mapping what’s next coming. All in a location poised to serve internationally as the epicenter of AI, tokenization and decentralized data. Learn more about MANTRA Disclaimer.

Nordea has over $286 billion in assets under management, according to its half-year results released in July, along with an estimated customer base of over 10 million people. Regulations are a key factor in the Bitcoin backflip In 2018, Nordea announced it was banning its employees from buying and holding Bitcoin over concerns the crypto market was unregulated, and it has stated in subsequent earnings reports that it has “no risk appetite or direct exposure to virtual currencies.” The change of heart has resulted directly from growing regulations and market maturity, the bank said, citing the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a specific example. “Nordea has closely monitored trends in cryptocurrencies but maintained a cautious approach due to the unregulated nature of crypto-assets and the lack of investor protection and authority supervision that dominated the emergence of digital currencies,” Nordea said.

Revolut’s offering will apply to Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ) across six blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana and Tron, Bashlykov noted. It comes about a week after Revolut secured a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, permitting it to offer regulated crypto services in 30 countries that are part of the European Economic Area. Bashlykov said the 1:1 conversions aren’t about getting a better rate but about “completely eliminating the pain of going on and offchain.” Source: Leonid Bashlykov The 1:1 conversions will have a profound impact on small to medium-sized businesses in countries facing economic challenges, such as Turkey, according to Elbruz Yılmaz, managing partner at venture capital firm Outrun, in response to Bashlykov’s post. He noted that SMBs lose considerable value when having to convert from a currency like the Turkish lira to the USD, which is further compounded by SWIFT fees and slippage when transferring funds across borders. “A clean one to one ramp turns stablecoins from a speculative asset into working capital infrastructure. Faster cycles. Less FX bleed. Better treasury control.” Bashlykov said Revolut will be covering the spread internally to ensure customers receive the 1:1 rate, provided the stablecoins maintain their pegs.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Many US senators are reportedly moving to advance a bill for crypto market structure rules amid a government shutdown with no end in sight. According to a Bloomberg report published on Thursday, several Republicans in the Senate, including those with leadership positions on key committees, plan to pass legislation on digital asset market structure by the end of the year, in line with their initially announced timeline. Despite thousands of government employees being furloughed across several agencies amid the shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive their paychecks and are permitted to conduct business in the House of Representatives and the Senate. John Boozman, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, reportedly said he was negotiating with Democrats to release a bipartisan bill on market structure “very, very soon,” with a plan to pass the legislation before 2026. Others on the Senate Banking Committee — the other body that needs to approve the bill once it’s ready for consideration — picked up bipartisan talks, with a possible deal being announced in a matter of weeks. The legislative fight began with the passage of the CLARITY Act in the House of Representatives. After being passed in July as part of Republicans’ “crypto week” plans, party leaders in the Senate said they would “build on” the bill to create their version of crypto market structure under the title the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. Related: Republican senator warns time is running out to pass US crypto bill: Report Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s most outspoken backers, said in August that she hoped the legislation would be considered by the Agriculture Committee by the end of September and the Banking Committee by the end of October, with US President Donald Trump expected to sign it into law by 2026. One committee deadline has since passed, and the other benchmark is unlikely to occur during the shutdown.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United Kingdom has opened the floodgates for crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors — a market that was previously limited to professional traders — sparking a price war among issuers vying for market share, according to the Financial Times. In a report published on Thursday, the FT said several Bitcoin ETN issuers have slashed their fees to as low as 0.05%, describing the resulting competition as a “cut-throat battle” for investors. Meanwhile, other crypto-linked ETNs continue to charge annual fees of up to 2.5%. The fee war follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to lift its 2021 ban on retail access to crypto-linked funds, a change that took effect on Oct. 8. At the time of the policy reversal, Ian Taylor, board adviser at trade association CryptoUK, told Cointelegraph : “We are delighted to see this reversal,” highlighting the “progress we’ve made toward introducing a more proportionate approach to consumer risk.” The Financial Conduct Authority’s roadmap for digital asset regulations.

One of the key flashpoints has been the treatment of stablecoins after industry participants pushed back against the Bank of England’s (BoE) proposals to impose strict corporate holding limits. According to Bloomberg, the BoE is now considering softening its stance amid growing concern that the United States is pulling ahead following the passage of the GENIUS Act, which aims to provide clearer rules for stablecoin issuers. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has also moderated his tone in recent months, stepping back from earlier warnings that private stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability.

Trump nominates pro-crypto lawyer to head CFTC The Trump administration has appointed Michael Selig, a pro-crypto lawyer and SEC counsel, to head up the CFTC. Listen 0:00 Profile COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may finally get a chairperson as President Donald Trump’s nominee, Michael Selig, begins the vetting process. The CFTC is currently under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who assumed the role in April 2025. She was nominated to the position by President Joe Biden in 2022 and unanimously confirmed by the Senate. The Trump administration initially picked former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who also sat on the board of gambling platform Kalshi. However, his nomination was withdrawn in September, reportedly at the request of the Winklevoss brothers, who were concerned that he was not sufficiently pro-crypto. Selig, who has previous experience in government at the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, has pledged to make crypto a priority. Michael Selig must first be nominated by the Senate. Source: Michael Selig Who is Michael Selig, and where does he stand on crypto? Selig, a graduate of the George Washington University Law School, began his career in government at the office of former CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo from 2014 to 2015. After leaving the CFTC, Selig was an associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, and Perkins Coie, where he became counsel. In April 2022, he joined Willkie Farr & Gallagher, becoming partner in January 2024. In March 2025, he became chief counsel to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force and a senior advisor to the chairman. Selig was unambiguously pro-crypto in an X post on Saturday, confirming his nomination . He said that “a Great Golden Age for America’s Financial Markets and a Wealth of New Opportunities stand before us,” adding that he will “help the President make the United States the Crypto Capital of the World.” Related: Trump weighs new CFTC chair candidates as Quintenz confirmation stalls David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, said that Selig is “passionate about modernizing our regulatory approach in order to maintain America’s competitiveness in the digital asset era.” “[Selig] has not only been instrumental in driving forward the President’s crypto agenda as Chief Counsel of the SEC Crypto Task Force, he also brings deep experience in traditional commodities markets from his time working at the CFTC under former Chairman Chris Giancarlo.” Industry observers noted Selig’s close analysis of the SEC v. Ripple case. In 2023, he contended that XRP “is simply computer code.” He called it a “fungible commodity, like gold or whiskey — both of which can also be sold as part of investment schemes that implicate securities laws.” He said the “SEC can’t argue a $2b penalty against Ripple with a straight face any better than it can the security status of XRP.” Source: Michael Selig This tack toward viewing digital assets as a commodity, rather than a security, is particularly important as Congress considers a reshuffling of crypto regulation. CFTC and SEC rebalance crypto regulation, but shutdown looms In the US Senate, lawmakers are currently deliberating over the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives in a simpler form called the “CLARITY Act” earlier this year, would reclassify many cryptocurrencies as commodities. Correspondingly, the responsibility of regulating a significant number of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin ( BTC ), would fall to the CFTC. The commission already acts as the primary regulator for crypto derivatives and has anti-fraud authority over the industry’s spot market. The bill is still under consideration, but the government shutdown and increasing bipartisanship have stalled progress significantly, blowing well past the end of September deadline Senator Tim Scott had been hoping for. Related: Democrats counter US crypto framework; bill grinds to a halt The SEC and CFTC have taken their own initiatives to align their approaches on cryptocurrencies. In September, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced a roundtable with the CFTC to align on cryptocurrency regulation and “ensure the SEC and CFTC operate side by side so that American innovation and investment can thrive.” Pham said that, in recent years, “the dynamic between our agencies could be described as one of competition rather than collaboration.” “It is not what we want. And it’s not the best way to serve the American people who rely on us.” Pham noted that the agencies were making joint recommendations to the administration’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets via the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint. The CFTC chair said that cross-agency collaboration will “foster innovation, remove jurisdictional ambiguities, and enhance market access and the freedom to choose for customers and investors.” Even these efforts are limited in their ability and scope so long as a government shutdown continues, former CFTC Chair Giancarlo previously told Cointelegraph . He said that it would be “very difficult for the CFTC to implement the rulemaking that’s required under the CLARITY Act under an acting chair without a full commission, or at least a partial commission.” Federal agencies are operating with skeleton crews, and Democrats and Republicans continue to spar over a funding bill. Lack of full staff has affected not only the CFTC and SEC’s ability to implement new rules but has also hampered the latter’s ability to consider crypto exchange-traded fund listings. With Selig’s nomination, the CFTC is poised to take on the role of regulating crypto. But first, the government must agree to a budget, and political heavyweights from the crypto industry like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss must approve.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) may reach a cumulative value of $2 trillion in the next three years as more global capital and payments migrate onto more efficient blockchain rails, according to investment bank Standard Chartered. The bank said in a Thursday report shared with Cointelegraph that the “trustless” structure of decentralized finance (DeFi) is poised to challenge the dominance of traditional financial (TradFi) systems controlled by centralized entities. DeFi’s growing use in payments and investments may bolster non-stablecoin tokenized RWAs to a $2 trillion market capitalization by 2028, the investment bank predicts. Of the $2 trillion, $750 billion is projected to flow into money-market funds, another $750 billion into tokenized US stocks, $250 billion into tokenized US funds, and another $250 billion into “less liquid” segments of private equity, including commodities, corporate debt and tokenized real estate.

Kendrick said the stablecoin expansion is reinforcing the broader DeFi ecosystem.

“In DeFi, liquidity begets new products, and new products beget new liquidity,” he wrote. “We believe a self-sustaining cycle of DeFi growth has started.” Despite the optimism, Standard Chartered said regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest threat to the RWA sector.

JPMorgan expects a broader rollout of Kinexys Fund Flow next year and expects to tokenize additional assets such as private credit and real estate. More flexible portfolios Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is a process of digitizing ownership of assets such as real estate, commodities or funds into digital tokens on a blockchain. Unlike traditional assets, tokenized versions offer more flexibility such as fractional ownership or usage as collateral. According to Anton Pil, who serves as head of global alternative investment solutions at JPMorgan’s asset management arm, Kinexys Fund Flow is an important step in transforming how investors allocate and manage private fund portfolios. “Enabling real-time tri-party settlement between fund managers, transfer agents and distributors will ultimately unlock new sources of liquidity and more flexible portfolio construction,” he said. Asset tokenization has emerged as one of the key trends in the past few years, with investment giants like BlackRock betting that every financial asset is set to be tokenized in the future. JPMorgan has been taking efforts to tokenize assets for a while now, though.

In September, ECB Board member Piero Cipollone flagged the middle of 2029 as a possible launch date and predicted that the European Parliament would likely come to a consensus on a digital euro by May 2026. Cipollone said a digital euro would ensure all Europeans have access to free, universally accepted digital means of payment, even in the event of major disruptions such as war or cyberattacks.

Wednesday’s rate cut was “fully priced in” by investors, who widely anticipated the decision , according to Matt Mena, a market analyst at investment company 21Shares. Mena also forecast: “November has historically been one of Bitcoin’s best-performing months, with positive returns in 8 of the past 12 years, averaging 46.02% returns. Overall, we remain moderately risk-on and see a credible path for Bitcoin to break its all-time high before year-end.” Asset prices remained flat or fell by modest amounts on Wednesday following the FOMC decision, with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling by about 2.4% at the time of writing, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments signaling that FOMC members are divided on a December rate cut.

Weakness in crypto shows traders are looking at macroeconomic headwinds like a weakening jobs market and inflation, despite believing that interest rate cuts will continue into 2026. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price tumbled to $109,200 ahead of Wednesday’s US Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While traders may have anticipated a degree of risking-off ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s announcement, BTC’s 6% drop from its Monday rally to $116,400 might be sharper than anticipated, especially considering that the consensus among analysts was a 25 basis point rate cut. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart (Binance perps). Source: Velo The Fed’s dot plot currently shows a baseline of three cuts in 2025. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are already predicting at least two more 25 basis point cuts by March and June of 2026, which would place the Fed’s benchmark in the 3% to 3.25% range, so with that view in mind, Bitcoin’s near-term price action is counter to traders’ expectations. Analysts at Hyblock, a crypto analytics company, said: “Recent history has shown that the FOMC leads to a price drop in BTC, followed by a move up. This was the case in both the no rate change and rate cut (last one) scenarios. If price does dip post-FOMC and signs of bullish confluence emerge, such as bid-heavy orderbooks, it would likely present good opportunities for investors.” Given that the market consensus leans toward rate cuts for the foreseeable future, investors’ focus has shifted to a “what comes next, beyond the cuts” point of view. The growing US job layoffs, the longer-term impact of President Trump’s tariff war, and whether or not the artificial intelligence sector is in a speculation-fueled bubble or an industry sitting on sound fundamentals are all factors that traders have at the front of their minds.

His startup, Architect Financial Technologies, has received approval in Bermuda to offer perpetual futures contracts tied to traditional assets such as stocks, indexes, commodities, foreign currencies and interest rates, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Source: Bloomberg Perpetual futures, or “perps,” let traders take leveraged long or short positions without contract expiry. To keep prices aligned with spot markets, exchanges use a funding rate mechanism, a periodic payment between long and short positions that balances demand.

While FTX Global offered crypto perps with leverage up to 100 times, FTX US, where Harrison served as president, operated as a separate, regulated entity and did not offer such products. Nevertheless, both exchanges collapsed in November 2022 following a severe liquidity crisis that exposed massive shortfalls and ultimately led to FTX’s bankruptcy filing.

Here's why @solana staking ETFs WILL attract… pic.twitter.com/syFGy6Dwm9 — Gareth Jenkinson (@gazza_jenks) October 29, 2025 Hougan said that until this point, investors stood to gain more by owning Solana in ways that allowed them to directly stake the asset and earn yield than invest in an ETF or product that didn’t allow for staking. “Once you put it into an ETF, you get all the great things about an ETF. Extremely low costs, institutional custody. You can purchase it in your brokerage account. It’s push-button easy. And you get that staking done for you,” Hougan said. “I think it's going to become one of the primary ways that people invest in Solana, globally. I think it's that big a deal.” Investors want custody AND staking yield Hougan unpacked the difference between conventional crypto ETFs like Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which primarily give investors exposure to the underlying asset. Staking ETFs have a twofold benefit for investors, as Hougan explained. “So as an investor in something like $BSOL, not only are you getting the returns of Solana, but every year you get somewhere around 7% of additional Solana on top of that. For a TradFi investor, it’s a little bit like a dividend in an oversimplified sense.” Hougan said the product also helps decentralize and secure the Solana network. The $BSOL ETF launched $222 million in assets, amounting to over 1.1 million SOL tokens. Source: Eric Balchunas Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that Bitwise’s SOL staking ETF had the largest trading volume of any ETF on debut in 2025. Regulatory change made Solana staking ETFs possible Hougan also credited a regulatory U-turn in the US as a catalyst for the eventual greenlight for Solana staking ETFs. During Gary Gensler’s term at the helm of the SEC, Bitcoin and Ether ETFs took years to get the regulatory green light. The Bitwise executive said that Solana staking ETFs would not have been “even remotely possible” if there had not been a significant change in attitude toward the cryptocurrency sector from US regulators. “Even just Solana unstaked was impossible, right? We barely got Ethereum through the Gary Gensler pinhole,” Hougan said. “And there was no way you were going to get anything else through that pinhole. And then to add staking on top of it, staking is more complex.” Related: Bitwise SOL staking ETF debuts with $223M assets, shows strong institutional demand He said a number of complexities also stumped regulators, including liquidity and tax implications. However, the launch of BSOL and Grayscale’s Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) could well open the door for other TradFi investment products linked to proof-of-stake protocols. “Not only have we done it now, but this also opens the door for a variety of other ETPs to launch that have staking as well.

Macro conditions favor BTC price rising Bitcoin bulls have projected the price to grow in the long term, citing macroeconomic catalysts that may mitigate any downside impact stemming from Mt.

Fink’s comments came after gold took another slide on Monday, with spot prices tumbling below $4,000 after touching all-time highs above $4,377 a week ago, according to TradingView data. The need for dollar sales is the “biggest issue” Addressing key concerns in the US economy, BlackRock’s Fink said that his biggest concern is the US dependency on selling dollars to international investors. “We still are a nation that needs 30% to 35% of all our Treasury sales going overseas, and, to me, that’s the biggest issue today,” Fink said at a panel at FII. “If that ever changed, it has a multiplier effect because of the dependency on selling dollar-based assets to foreigners,” he added, noting the need to unlock private capital. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. Source: YouTube At the event, Fink also addressed the biggest concerns of global central banks, which have increasingly been hoarding gold , marking a major emerging shift in global finance this year. Central banks’ biggest question “I would say the biggest question from central banks is what role tokenization and digitization will play,” Fink said, referring to the many challenges central bankers worldwide face in navigating the emerging tokenization industry . He highlighted some of the pressing questions, such as how quickly central banks should digitize their own currencies, the implications for the US dollar and the impact on payment systems, among others. Gold’s share of central bank reserves reached 24% in Q2 of 2025. Source: Deutsche Bank “I think we spend so much time talking about AI. We’re not spending enough time talking about how quickly we’re going to tokenize every financial asset,” the BlackRock CEO said, adding: “And I think that’s going to happen worldwide very rapidly. And I think most countries are ill prepared for that and under-appreciate how technology is changing that.” Fink’s latest insights on the role of tokenization, as well as on assets such as crypto and gold, align with his long-standing view that all traditional financial assets would likely be tokenized over the coming decades.

With XRP trading above $2.60 at the time of publication, the company’s XRP holdings have surpassed the $1 billion mark — a significant milestone in XRP accumulation that came just days after Evernorth’s official debut on Oct. 20 as an institutional vehicle for XRP adoption.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A US lawmaker is seeking to ban US President Donald Trump, his family, and members of Congress from trading crypto or stocks. US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat representative from California’s 17th Congressional District and vice-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, used an appearance on MSNBC to raise concerns around Trump’s apparent conflict of interest with crypto via his son’s crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), alleging the recent pardoning of Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was “blatant corruption.” “You’ve got a foreign billionaire who was basically engaged in money-laundering,” Khanna said of CZ, adding, “then he petitions for a pardon from Donald Trump after basically funneling money to terrorists.” However, CZ recently fired back at similar accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, claiming she “can’t get her facts right.” CZ pleaded guilty to a single felony count of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act after failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at Binance. Khanna alleged that the Binance co-founder was being let off the hook due to Binance’s financial backing of WLFI — echoing recent sentiments from US Representative Maxine Waters. “And what he does is he says ‘I’m going to support World Liberty,’ which is the president’s son’s cryptocurrency firm, which they’re making millions of dollars on while Donald Trump is president. And Donald Trump gives him a pardon while he is basically financing Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency stablecoin.” Trump has faced criticism for his ties to WLFI on multiple occasions; however, his son Eric Trump has consistently denied that his father has any connection to the project. In an interview in September, Eric stressed that his father “is running a nation. He’s not involved in our businesses in any way, shape or form."" Rep Khanna discusses his reasoning for introducing the new legislation.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED S&P Global Ratings has given Michael Saylor’s Strategy a “B-” credit rating, placing it in the speculative, non-investment-grade territory — often referred to as a “junk bond” — although it said the Bitcoin treasury company’s outlook remains stable. “We view Strategy’s high bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low US dollar liquidity as weaknesses,” the credit rating platform said in a review of Strategy on Monday. Strategy has accumulated its 640,808 BTC treasury mainly via equity and debt financing. The stable outlook assumes the company will prudently manage convertible debt maturities and maintain preferred stock dividends, potentially through additional debt issuance, it said. S&P Global highlighted that Strategy faces an “inherent currency mismatch,” with all debt due in US dollars while much of its dollar reserves are allocated to fund its software business, which operates at approximately breakeven in earnings and cash flow.

Strategy is on par with Sky Protocol Strategy received the same score as decentralized stablecoin issuer Sky Protocol, previously MakerDAO, in August. S&P Global pointed to Sky Protocol’s high depositor concentration, centralized governance and weak capitalization to justify the B-minus rating. Strategy’s B-minus rating will need to bump up six levels — to BBB-minus —  in order to escape the “junk bond” zone.

Strategy must increase US liquidity, reduce reliance on debt While S&P Global said an upgrade in the next 12 months is unlikely, it noted that it could raise the ratings if Strategy improves its US dollar liquidity, eases convertible debt, and continues to demonstrate strong access to capital markets, including when Bitcoin retraces. Related: BCP becomes first Peruvian bank to offer regulated crypto access However, S&P Global said there’s a risk that Strategy’s convertible debt may be due at a time of a “severe Bitcoin stress,” forcing them to liquidate some of its Bitcoin at “depressed prices.” Strategy’s score could also fall lower if its access to capital markets weakens, crunching its ability to raise funds and continue its Bitcoin strategy.

The move requires Senate approval and comes as the agency operates with several open seats. In Saturday X posts, Selig and White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks confirmed reports that Trump would nominate him to chair the CFTC , setting the groundwork for the departure of acting Chair Caroline Pham. Selig, whose nomination did not appear in congressional records nor among official White House announcements at the time of publication, reiterated Trump’s goal of making the US a “crypto capital.” Source: Michael Selig The nomination came amid a US government shutdown entering its fifth week after Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress were unable to reach an agreement on a funding bill over concerns with healthcare cuts and subsidies. Though the Senate is still able to pass legislation during a shutdown — including potentially a digital asset market structure bill – lawmakers’ priority will likely be a continuing resolution to fund the government. Since the departure of CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson in September, the agency’s five-member leadership panel has been filled solely by Pham, who also said she intends to depart the regulator after her replacement is confirmed in the Senate.

However, reports suggested that Trump was considering Nathan Anonick, a professional staff member and counsel to the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Paul Balzano, a senior professional staff member with the House Agriculture Committee.

The offering would store clients’ Bitcoin and Ether holdings through a third-party custodian, according to people who spoke to the news outlet. If confirmed, the development could make the two leading cryptocurrencies more attractive for institutional investors, akin to the historic approval of the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January 2024.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto market observers have locked their gaze on the delayed US inflation report for September, which is expected to be published on Friday and to exceed 3% for the first time in 2025, which could have a knock-on effect on crypto markets. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to publish the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September on Friday. It has been delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown, which is now in its 24th day. Economists forecast that September inflation rose 0.4% monthly and 3.1% annually, so it would be the first time headline CPI would exceed 3% this year, according to Trading Economics. CPI print could impact crypto The CPI report will be the first major data release since the US government shutdown at the beginning of this month. Investor Ted Pillows said that if CPI comes in at 3.1% or more, odds of a rate cut could go down, but if it comes in at 3% or lower, “it’ll be good for the markets.” Related: US gov shutdown ‘likely’ to end this week: Trump adviser Analyst “Ash Crypto” concurred , stating that higher than 3.1% will be bearish for markets “because it’ll mark the highest CPI print since June 2024.” Around 3.1% will be in line with expectations, but below 3.1% is the “perfect scenario for risk-on assets.” “Rate cuts will happen, and also the MoM increase in CPI will be just 0.1% or 1.2% annualized. This will also boost chances of more rate cuts and will cause liquidity to flow into risk-on assets.” “We realize that the Fed has said that their focus is now on the employment picture, but whether tomorrow’s CPI data is a lot different than expectations or not could still have an impact on their thinking,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told Bloomberg. “So, it will still have a big impact on the markets if it is indeed out of line with what the consensus is thinking,” But hotter-than-expected inflation figures will not likely deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates, according to Barron’s. The central bank is more focused on the weakening labor market, and the probability of a rate cut next Wednesday is 98.3%, according to CME futures prediction markets. However, the ongoing government shutdown could complicate the economic picture ahead of the Fed’s December meeting, when another rate cut is expected. US inflation is expected to tick up again.

On Thursday, Spark said it allocated $100 million of its stablecoin reserves to Superstate’s Crypto Carry Fund (USCC), a regulated basis-trading fund that generates yield from price differentials between spot and futures markets across major digital assets. The fund allows DeFi protocols to earn market-neutral yield from the same derivatives markets traditionally used by hedge funds.

Although the Federal Reserve has struggled to anchor the long end of the yield curve, in part due to mounting US fiscal pressures, the 10-year Treasury yield recently fell below 4%. Spark noted that the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle could pressure stablecoin issuers and DeFi protocols heavily exposed to short-duration Treasurys, forcing them to seek alternative, uncorrelated sources of return.

ABA’s senior vice president of innovation and strategy, Brooke Ybarra, said if major crypto exchanges such as Kraken or Coinbase were allowed to pay interest on payment stablecoins, it would “fly in the face” of the idea that stablecoins should be used for payments and not as a store of value. “A detriment to who?” Ripley said . “Consumers should have the freedom to choose where they hold value and the most efficient way to send that value.” Kraken CEO argues crypto industry is building “something else” Ripley argued that banks have been earning fees on customers’ assets without passing on benefits back to them, adding: “We are building toward something else — a system where services once reserved for the wealthy are accessible to everyone.” Others in the crypto industry echoed Ripley’s criticism. Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Blockchain Association, said , “Big Banks are ruthlessly targeting our friends at @Coinbase and @KrakenFX to protect their turf.” “Translation: competition’s winning,” Spuller said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Large Bitcoin holders who accumulated the cryptocurrency early, commonly known as whales, are increasingly moving their holdings into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with asset managers such as BlackRock actively courting them. In an interview with Bloomberg , Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said the company has already facilitated more than $3 billion worth of these conversions into its iShares spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). After years of self-custody, many whales are recognizing “the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship,” Mitchnick said. This shift allows them to maintain Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure while integrating their wealth into the traditional financial system, enabling easier access to broader investment and lending services. Mitchnick partly attributed this trend to a recent US Securities and Exchange Commission rule change that permits in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs. The adjustment allows authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for Bitcoin rather than cash, making large-scale conversions more efficient and tax-friendly for institutional investors.

In June, IBIT became the fastest ETF in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management — a figure that has since climbed to over $88 billion, according to data from Bitbo. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a surge in net inflows as investors pile in during the current bull run. Source: Bitbo Related: BlackRock sees record quarter for iShares ETFs as Bitcoin, Ether demand surges Not your keys, not your coins? The trend identified by Mitchnick underscores the growing institutionalization of Bitcoin, more than 15 years after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block and envisioned a bearer asset built on the principle of self-custody. Early Bitcoin advocates have long argued that self-custody is the only foolproof way to safeguard one’s funds — a core tenet captured by the mantra, “not your keys, not your coins.” Yet the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury holdings is challenging that ideal, signaling a shift toward more conventional, custodial forms of ownership. While spot Bitcoin ETFs and direct holdings aren’t necessarily in competition — each serving different types of investors — analyst Willy Woo noted in July that ETF demand may have siphoned interest away from self-custody. Onchain data, he said, show that self-custodied Bitcoin recently broke a 15-year uptrend, marking a potential turning point in investor behavior.

Per the report, the FSA plans to discuss the reform at an upcoming meeting of the Financial Services Council, an advisory body to the Prime Minister. The initiative aims to align crypto asset management with traditional financial products like stocks and government bonds. Regulators are expected to explore a framework for managing crypto-related risks, such as sharp price swings that could impact a bank’s financial health.

In this “magic trick,” DATs essentially transferred wealth from retail investors who overpaid for shares into actual Bitcoin ( BTC ) for the company. Shareholders lost billions while executives accumulated real BTC, they said. The researchers used Metaplanet, the fourth-largest Bitcoin treasury firm, as an example, as the company effectively transformed a market capitalization of $8 billion, supported by just $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings, into a $3.1 billion market cap backed by $3.3 billion in BTC.

The shakeout has also separated the real operators from marketing machines. The firms that survive this transition will be battle-tested, well-capitalized, and equipped to generate consistent returns, creating a new category of Bitcoin asset managers. DATs that adapt now will “define the next bull market,” the researchers said before concluding: “Bitcoin itself will continue to evolve, and Digital Asset Treasury firms with strong capital bases and trading-savvy management teams may still generate meaningful alpha.” Strategy, Metaplanet stock sinks Strategy stock (MSTR) gained 2% on Friday, ending the trading session at $289.87.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Three of Japan’s largest banks reportedly plan to jointly issue a yen-pegged stablecoin, contributing to the region’s growing adoption of crypto technology within its financial infrastructure. Nikkei reported on Friday that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC) and Mizuho Bank plan to modernize corporate settlements and reduce transaction costs through a yen-based stablecoin project built on MUFG’s stablecoin issuance platform Progmat. The banks, which collectively serve more than 300,000 corporate clients, aim to standardize the token to make it interoperable for payments within and between companies. The consortium expects to roll out the stablecoin by the end of the year. Mitsubishi Corp. will be the first entity to implement the stablecoin for internal settlements. With over 240 subsidiaries globally, the company aims to streamline international transfers on dividends, acquisitions and customer transactions, saving on fees and administrative burdens. If successful, the project could establish Japan’s first bank-backed stablecoin network under a unified framework Cointelegraph reached out to MUFG, SMBC and Mizuho for comments, but had not received a response by publication. MUFG launched the Progmat stablecoin platform in June The news follows the launch of MUFG’s stablecoin issuance platform “Progmat Coin.” In June, MUFG said the platform would be used by banks in Japan to issue yen-pegged stablecoins on several public blockchain networks. MUFG said at the time that Progmat Coin will be used to facilitate the issuance of bank-backed stablecoins on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche and Cosmos. The bank said it plans to add more networks in the future. On Sept. 26, Binance Japan teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp. (MUTB) to explore the issuance of stablecoins using Progmat Coin. Binance Japan general manager Takeshi Chino said stablecoins are crucial for the broader financial ecosystem and that these assets will fill an important role in financial services and are vital for Web3 adoption.

The report said that the Tokyo-based fintech firm JPYC will lead the stablecoin rollout. In the same month, the Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group also announced that it was considering launching a stablecoin pegged to the Japanese yen. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Monex chairman Oki Matsumoto said the company risked being left behind if it didn’t move into stablecoins. However, he also acknowledged that issuance may require significant infrastructure and capital.

As a result of the protocol-based liquid staking activities underlying stETH, “the trust expects to accrue certain staking rewards through its ownership of stETH,” it stated. VanEck took early steps toward launching the product by registering a statutory trust in Delaware on Oct. 2. stETH is a liquid staking token that represents deposited Ether ( ETH ) plus any staking rewards that accrue, allowing holders to earn yields while maintaining liquidity. Lido is the largest liquid staking platform with almost 8.5 million ETH worth around $33 billion staked. It currently offers a 3.3% staking yield on deposited ETH.

Listen 0:00 How to COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways Grayscale has bridged traditional finance and decentralized crypto by launching the first publicly traded staking investment vehicle. Its staking-enabled ETPs allow investors to earn blockchain rewards without running validator nodes or managing complex technical and custody risks. Grayscale’s Ether and Solana ETPs are the first in the US to combine spot crypto exposure with staking rewards, paying yields through the fund’s NAV or direct payouts. These products face operational challenges, such as validator performance issues and liquidity lock-ups, as well as regulatory and centralization risks linked to institutional staking. Wall Street and the crypto world have long operated in separate spaces. While Wall Street was defined by traditional finance and clear regulatory norms, the crypto industry evolved around decentralized systems and shifting regulations. That divide is now narrowing, thanks to the launch of the first publicly traded investment vehicle dedicated to staking cryptocurrency . Launched by Grayscale Investments , one of the largest digital asset managers, this staking-enabled exchange-traded product (ETP) signals a new phase in crypto’s maturation and integration with traditional finance. It’s more than a fund; it’s a bridge providing traditional investors a regulated pathway to tap into the growth potential of crypto staking. This article discusses what crypto staking is, what has prevented greater institutional participation and how Grayscale has encouraged the institutionalization of crypto investment. It also highlights regulatory and market changes surrounding staking and explains how Grayscale’s spot crypto ETPs deliver staking yields to investors. Finally, it outlines the risks associated with staking funds and shows how Grayscale’s ETPs have shifted crypto from a price-tracking asset to an income-generating one. Crypto staking and institutional barriers Crypto staking involves committing digital assets like Ether ( ETH ) or Solana ( SOL ) to help secure and validate transactions on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains . In return, participants earn rewards — similar in concept to earning interest — for supporting network operations. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model, which relies on energy-intensive mining, PoS systems operate differently. They depend on staked capital and validator performance rather than computing power. This design makes them far more energy-efficient and accessible to a wider range of participants. In general, both retail and institutional investors continue to focus on buying and holding tokens for price gains rather than staking them. Operating validator nodes requires substantial capital, technical know-how and uninterrupted uptime. It also exposes participants to risks such as slashing penalties and custody challenges. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, the regulatory treatment of staking rewards remains unclear. Did you know? The first US Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), launched on Oct. 19, 2021, and traded more than $1 billion in volume on its first day. Grayscale’s role in crypto institutionalization Grayscale has played a central role in the institutionalization of crypto. Founded in 2013, it has grown into one of the world’s largest digital asset investment platforms, managing over $35 billion in assets. It has now launched staking-enabled products that bring blockchain yield mechanics into Wall Street’s traditional framework. By offering regulated and user-friendly investment products, Grayscale allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without the challenges of managing wallets , operating nodes or dealing with validator risks. Through staking-enabled offerings like the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), Grayscale has integrated the yield-generating features of blockchain networks with the regulatory and custodial standards of traditional finance. By using trusted custodians, a diversified network of validator partners and transparent reporting, Grayscale has established a secure and compliant way for investors to participate in staking. It has turned staking from a complex, retail-oriented process into a professional investment opportunity. Did you know? After years of rejections, the US approved its first spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024 — a major milestone in Wall Street’s acceptance of crypto. The turning point: Regulatory and market shifts Grayscale’s introduction of staking-enabled funds marks a key milestone shaped by evolving oversight and growing market competition. The US Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance for crypto ETPs in May 2025, clarifying that certain custodial staking activities may operate within existing securities laws when managed through regulated custodians and transparent structures. This development has eased earlier barriers that prevented ETFs from earning onchain rewards. Meanwhile, competition has intensified as major players such as BlackRock and Fidelity have entered the crypto ETF arena, driving innovation. In response, Grayscale rolled out staking-enabled ETPs that blend yield generation with traditional fund frameworks. To enhance investor trust, it launched educational initiatives such as “Staking 101: Secure the Blockchain, Earn Rewards” to promote transparency and understanding. Did you know? In 2025, Ether ETFs began allowing onchain staking, letting investors earn yield without ever touching a crypto wallet. How Grayscale’s spot crypto ETPs are delivering staking yield to investors Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) are spot Ether ETPs that now support onchain staking. Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) has also enabled staking while trading over the counter. Together, these offerings are the first US-listed products to combine spot crypto exposure with staking rewards. Each fund features a unique reward structure. ETHE pays staking rewards directly to investors, while ETH and GSOL incorporate rewards into the fund’s net asset value (NAV), gradually impacting share price. After deductions for custodian and sponsor fees, investors receive a net yield from validator rewards. Operationally, Grayscale uses institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers for passive staking. This configuration helps manage risks like slashing or downtime while supporting liquidity . Clear disclosures, reporting and adherence to regulatory frameworks enhance investor confidence. Grayscale staked 32,000 ETH (about $150 million) a day after it enabled staking for its Ether ETPs, making it the first US crypto fund issuer to offer staking-based passive income via US-listed spot products. Risks and criticisms of Grayscale’s staking funds Regulatory uncertainty remains a key issue for staking-enabled products. Unlike fully registered ETFs under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH are structured as ETPs with different investor protections and disclosure requirements. GSOL, still traded over the counter, is awaiting regulatory approval for uplisting, creating uncertainty about its long-term status and oversight. Future policy changes or stricter SEC enforcement could further complicate the model or limit staking within regulated funds. Operationally, risks such as validator performance, slashing events and downtime persist. Balancing liquidity with staking lock-ups and ensuring fair, transparent distribution of rewards among shareholders adds further complexity to fund management. Market adoption poses another challenge. It needs to be seen how staking-enabled ETPs perform when competing with Ether ETFs . Decentralization concerns are also significant. Institutional staking may enhance validator control, granting large funds outsized influence over governance and network security of the underlying blockchains. This would be against the core principles of decentralization. How Grayscale’s ETPs transform crypto from price tracker to income asset Grayscale’s staking-enabled ETPs have had a significant impact on Wall Street and the broader crypto ecosystem. It connects blockchain-based yield with regulated financial products, turning crypto ETPs from simple price trackers into income-generating assets. The initiative marks a key advance in institutional adoption. Regulated staking on Ethereum and Solana could draw substantial new capital to these networks while acting as a model for products linked to other PoS blockchains or tokenized assets. At the network level, institutional staking could enhance security and protocol stability. However, it may spark concerns about centralization if large funds dominate validator roles. This could affect yields and governance balance. Grayscale’s staking-enabled ETPs will shape upcoming funds, influencing standards for transparency, risk disclosures, taxation and investor safeguards.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED BlackRock has redesigned one of its flagship money market funds to meet new US stablecoin rules. The $13.5 trillion asset manager said the revamped fund, called the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL), will help manage reserves for companies behind US dollar-pegged stablecoins, offering them a safe place to park customer funds, according to CNBC. “We want to be — and we believe we are — a preeminent reserve manager” for stablecoin issuers, Jon Steel, the global head of product and platform for BlackRock’s cash management business, told CNBC. BlackRock noted that the offering aligns with the GENIUS Act , a law signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year that created the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins. The new rules outline how issuers must hold and invest their reserves, which BlackRock’s new fund aims to comply with.

Standard Chartered and OKX launched a collateral mirroring program in the EEA, allowing local institutional clients to keep their crypto directly in Standard Chartered’s custody, OKX announced on Wednesday. The launch marks an expansion of a pilot initially launched in Dubai in April, aiming to enable institutions to keep their assets with a globally systemically important bank (G-SIB) while mirroring the balances into OKX for trading.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED During a recent event in Washington, DC, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins said the United States is a decade behind in crypto and that addressing the issue is a priority for the regulator. During the DC Fintech Week event on Wednesday, Atkins said he thinks the United States is “probably 10 years behind” on cryptocurrency. “The crypto aspect is our job one,” he said. Atkins said the SEC aims to “build a strong framework to actually attract people back into the United States who may have fled.” The agency wants this framework to allow innovation to thrive. “I like to say that we’re the securities and innovation commission now,“ he quipped. Exemptions for innovation Atkins explained that developing suitable crypto regulation is part of the “embrace of innovation,” and that the SEC is working full-time on crypto regulation. He hinted at an “innovation exemption” to allow for experimentation with new ideas. “We at SEC with respect to our statutes have pretty broad authority for exemptions to be made, and so I think we can be, you know, very forward-leaning in that in order to accommodate new ideas,“ he said.

Still, increasing US regulatory support may tip the balance in favor of developing such services.

Despite CME’s lead in open interest, unregulated exchanges still dominate trading volumes, especially in altcoin and perpetual futures. Friday’s cryptocurrency market crash wiped out a record $74 billion in leveraged positions across the industry. Although prices recovered more than half of the losses within a few hours, the damage to futures open interest had already been done. The movement triggered an unexpected shift that could mark the “end of an era” for unregulated cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Aggregate cryptocurrency futures open interest, USD.

Total liquidations reported by CoinGlass reached a record-high $19.2 billion, while the effective number should be far higher as some exchanges underreport their data . Futures open interest at top exchanges, USD. Source: CoinGlass / Cointelegraph Aggregate CME futures open interest in the top four cryptocurrencies reached $28.3 billion on Wednesday, surpassing Binance’s $23 billion and Bybit’s $12.2 billion. While this marks a major step toward institutional capital driving price discovery, it doesn’t mean exchanges have lost their competitive edge. CME leads open interest, but trading stays on exchanges Binance still dominates smaller altcoin futures with $7 billion spread across ( BNB ), ( DOGE ), (HYPE) and similar assets, while Bybit holds another $4.4 billion. In addition, the top three exchanges — Binance, OKX, and Bybit — collectively trade over $100 billion per day in BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP futures, compared with CME’s $14 billion daily average. Even as CME emerges as the leading market in open interest, trading activity remains heavily concentrated on lesser-regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, where perpetual futures contracts (inverse swaps) dominate instead of weekly or monthly expiries. CME Bitcoin futures open interest, USD. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin futures open interest at CME stood at $16.2 billion on Wednesday, down 11% from $18.3 billion before Friday’s crash. Binance saw a sharper 22% drop over the same period. The difference largely stems from Binance’s higher leverage, broader use of cross-collateral and its significantly larger share of retail traders. How Binance’s portfolio margin works. Source: Binance The complex liquidation process tied to portfolio margin and the sudden flash crash in several cryptocurrencies on Binance triggered auto-deleverage mechanisms across the broader market, also disrupting pricing oracles used by decentralized exchanges. CME futures were unaffected since trading halts at 4:00 pm Central Time on Friday and resumes on Sunday. Related: Crypto ‘got a passing grade’ on weekend crash: Bitwise’s Matt Hougan Another distinction is that CME futures are cash-settled and require a maintenance margin of around 40%, roughly limiting traders to 2.5x leverage. In contrast, unregulated cryptocurrency derivatives platforms often offer up to 100x leverage and accept a wide range of collateral, including altcoins and synthetic stablecoins. CME plans to introduce 24-hour trading for futures and options in early 2026, pending regulatory approval, a move that could drive greater demand and potentially shift trading volumes away from crypto exchanges. For now, however, CME’s lead in open interest alone doesn’t signal the “end of an era” for unregulated cryptocurrency derivatives markets.

The CME FedWatch tool shows a 96.7% probability of a 25% interest rate cut, fueling optimism. Inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs and equities correlation hint at a potential rebound. Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be down 4.3% in October so far, but optimism around the month’s historically bullish trend remains intact. Since 2019, Bitcoin’s average October gain has been near 20%, with a median return of about 15%. While this year’s performance currently lags, market participants are looking to macroeconomic policy shifts for potential fuel. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut now stands at 96.7% for a 25-basis-point reduction. A cut in interest rates generally signals more liquidity entering the system, reducing borrowing costs and supporting risk-on sentiment across asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have absorbed nearly $5 billion in net inflows in the first two weeks of October, indicating renewed confidence from large investors. Cointelegraph reported that total institutional holdings across public companies have now climbed to $117 billion, a 28% quarterly rise, with over 1 million BTC collectively held in corporate treasuries. In Q3, 48 new entities joined the cohort, expanding institutional reach into digital assets. Related: Bitcoin to $74K?

However, as markets stabilized early this week, US stocks began recovering, though Bitcoin’s rebound has lagged. According to the Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, Jurrien Timmer , the recent pullback resembled the late-1990s “super bull” phase, when speculative assets saw sharp but temporary drawdowns before surging higher again. If US equities sustain their recovery heading into earnings season, it could create favorable conditions for Bitcoin ’s own upside revival. A renewed rally in tech and growth stocks, bolstered by easier monetary policy, might help extend “Uptober” optimism into a stronger finish for the month.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Erebor, a financial services company backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, has received regulatory approval to launch in the United States, a move that could help fill the gap left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. According to a report by the Financial Times on Wednesday, Erebor secured a preliminary banking charter but must still clear several compliance and security hurdles before it can begin operations. That process could take several months. The approval was confirmed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), with Comptroller Jonathan V. Gould saying that “permissible digital asset activities [...] have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner.” Source: OCC Erebor is positioning itself as a lender to the so-called innovation economy, focusing on businesses in sectors such as cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and advanced technology. “We want to be a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk,” a person close to the company told the Financial Times. Earlier reports indicated that Erebor aims to become a key source of funding for early-stage startups that have struggled to access traditional capital markets amid tighter regulatory scrutiny. Much of that caution followed the US regional banking turmoil of March 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank , Silvergate Bank , Signature Bank and First Republic Bank all collapsed or were taken over. Rising interest rates also made it harder for companies to secure financing. Related: Peter Thiel vs. Michael Saylor: Crypto treasury bet or bubble? Regulatory shifts spur crypto firms to expand The approval comes amid a wave of regulatory momentum in the United States, as President Donald Trump has signed a major stablecoin bill into law and Congress weighs additional legislation on crypto market structure and restrictions on a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Several crypto companies are seizing the moment to seek regulatory approval for expanded operations. Crypto exchange Coinbase has applied for a national trust company charter with the OCC, joining several other digital asset firms seeking similar licenses. Although Coinbase has said it does not intend to become a bank, the charter would allow it to expand into areas such as payments and custody services. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has also applied to establish a national trust bank , while Ripple Labs has filed for a similar license . Nevertheless, the move hasn’t been welcomed by everyone. US banking and credit union trade groups have urged the OCC to delay granting bank charters to crypto companies, citing “significant policy and process concerns.” Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long pushed back against those objections, pointing out that the issue is likely to end up in court. Long argued that the question of whether trust charters can function as de facto bank charters — allowing institutions to make loans and obtain Federal Reserve master accounts with only a fraction of the capital required of full-service banks — is “very likely to be litigated.” Source: Caitlin Long Related: Bank lobby is 'panicking' about yield-bearing stablecoins — NYU professor # Business # Banks # Peter Thiel # United States # Regulation Add reaction","Sam Bourgi Oct 15, 2025 Thiel-backed Erebor wins US approval as Silicon Valley Bank rival emerges Erebor’s green light from US regulators is among the most significant bank charter approvals tied to digital assets since the 2023 regional banking crisis.",CoinTelegraph,2025-10-15 16:35:36+00:00,2025-12-07 12:21:29.917209,2025-12-07T19:17:44.685058

On Tuesday, US prosecutors filed a forfeiture complaint for the roughly $14.4 billion tied to the alleged scam network led by Chen Zhi, the group’s founder. The DOJ said the Bitcoin in question is already in custody and will be subject to forfeiture following Zhi’s potential conviction on wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges. According to the DOJ, Zhi and his co-conspirators laundered the illicit proceeds of their operations to fund large-scale crypto mining operations. This included a Laos-based company called Warp Data, its Texas-based subsidiary and the China-based LuBian, which emerged as the sixth-largest Bitcoin mining pool in 2020. The DOJ said these companies “produced large sums of clean Bitcoin dissociated from criminal proceeds.” Related: Bitcoin metric shows ‘euphoria’ as $112.5K BTC price squeezes new buyers Bitcoin seizure could place funds in US reserves If the court approves the forfeiture, the recovered Bitcoin could become one of the largest additions to the US government’s digital asset holdings to date.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The crypto market faced its biggest leveraged wipeout in history last weekend, but the turbulence won’t leave a lasting mark, according to Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a Tuesday blog post, Hougan described the sharp drop as “a blip” and not a big deal. He added that crypto “got a passing grade” in its handling of the sell-off. “Many DeFi platforms performed flawlessly: Uniswap, Hyperliquid, Aave and others reported no losses,” he wrote, while noting that Binance and some other exchanges faced issues. “Taken together, crypto did as well or better than traditional markets would have done in the same situation,” he said. The crash occurred after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, sparking fears of a trade war. Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunged nearly 15%, while altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) dropped as much as 40%. Roughly $20 billion in leveraged positions was liquidated.

Source: Axel Adler Jr Related: Crypto crash unlikely to have derailed ‘Uptober,' analysts say Damage was “contained” By Monday, Bitcoin rebounded to around $115,000, almost erasing the weekend losses. Hougan said the rapid recovery indicates the strength of blockchain infrastructure. “The damage was contained to individual investors,” he added, noting that no major institutions collapsed during the event. The Bitwise exec said the sell-off was mostly fueled by highly leveraged traders rather than fundamental shifts. He claimed nothing fundamental to crypto’s outlook, including its underlying technology, security or the regulatory environment, had changed. “Over time,” Hougan concluded, “I expect the market will catch its breath and renew its attention on crypto’s fundamentals. When that happens, I think the bull market will continue apace.” Related: Binance rolls out $400M program for traders hit by Friday’s downturn Analysts split over record crypto liquidation Meanwhile, analysts are divided over Friday’s record crypto market liquidation. Some have accused major market makers of orchestrating a coordinated sell-off, while others have called it a natural deleveraging event. The flash crash sent open interest in perpetual futures plummeting from $26 billion to under $14 billion, while decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume surged past $177 billion, and crypto lending fees hit an all-time high of $20 million. Analysts at CryptoQuant said the data suggested an orderly market reset rather than a panic-driven collapse. Of the $14 billion wiped from open interest, roughly 93% represented controlled deleveraging, and only $1 billion in Bitcoin longs were liquidated. However, some observers blamed liquidity withdrawal by market makers for deepening the crash. Blockchain investigator YQ said liquidity began disappearing from order books around an hour after Trump’s tariff threat, creating a “liquidity vacuum” that saw market depth fall 98% before prices bottomed out.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japan’s securities regulator is reportedly set to introduce regulations to ban and punish crypto insider trading, bringing it more in line with how the country handles stock trading. Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission would be authorized to investigate suspicious trading activity and hit violators with fines based on how much they profited from insider trading, Nikkei Asia reported on Tuesday. The securities regulator would also make criminal referrals in more serious cases. There are no insider trading rules under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act that cover crypto, and the self-regulated Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association lacks a monitoring system to spot suspicious trading, prompting the need for stronger regulatory oversight in the crypto markets. The Financial Services Agency, the SESC’s parent organization, will discuss the details of the regulatory framework through a working group by the end of 2025, with the goal of submitting a proposed amendment to the FIEA next year. Japanese regulators have limited experience dealing with crypto insider trading cases, partly due to the fact that many tokens lack an identifiable issuer, making it difficult to determine who qualifies as an insider, according to Nikkei Asia.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crown, a São Paulo-based fintech company, has raised $8.1 million to launch a Brazilian real–denominated stablecoin designed to give institutional investors access to Brazil’s high-yield fixed-income market. The new stablecoin, called BRLV, may make it easier for global investors to tap the country’s double-digit interest rates, which are often difficult to reach due to local regulations and capital controls. BRLV is fully backed by Brazilian government bonds, which offer yields far higher than those in more mature economies. According to TradingEconomics, the 10-year Brazilian government bond yield is about 14%, after recently peaking near 15.2%. That has made Brazil one of the most attractive sovereign bond markets globally, though foreign investors often face bureaucracy, complex tax rules and currency-conversion hurdles when trying to invest directly. The yield on government bonds is shaped by market expectations around the Central Bank of Brazil’s benchmark Selic rate , which currently stands at 15% after a series of increases this year aimed at containing inflation.

Source: TradingEconomics By issuing a tokenized version of the real backed by government debt, Crown said it wants to simplify access to the country’s fixed-income market and provide a digital alternative for holding BRL-linked assets. “The safest way to manage stablecoin reserves and ensure every token is fully backed is to invest those reserves in government bonds,” said John Delaney, Crown’s co-founder and CEO. “Whereas most stablecoin issuers retain this income for themselves, we wanted to make the model fairer for our institutional partners” through an income-sharing mechanism, he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A US federal court has unsealed a criminal indictment involving a massive cryptocurrency fraud scheme that could result in the government increasing its national Bitcoin reserves by $14 billion. In a Tuesday notice from the US Justice Department, authorities said they had filed a forfeiture complaint against 127,271 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth about $14.4 billion at the time of publication. The Bitcoin was tied to an indictment against Chen Zhi, founder and chair of a Cambodia-based company that was allegedly responsible for orchestrating “pig butchering” crypto investment schemes. Civil forfeiture complaint against 127,271 Bitcoin. Source: US District Court, Eastern District of New York The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Zhi’s company, the Prince Holding Group, and its affiliates on the same day the indictment was unsealed. According to the complaint, the US will seek forfeiture upon Zhi’s conviction in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, where he faces charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. The Justice Department said the Bitcoin was “presently in the custody of the US government.” If approved by the court following Zhi’s potential conviction, the Bitcoin forfeiture would represent one of the most significant additions of cryptocurrency to the US strategic reserve since its establishment. US President Donald Trump set up national Bitcoin and crypto reserves via executive order in March. Related: South Korea ramps up crypto seizures, will target cold wallets Some of the proceeds of the crypto scheme were allegedly used to purchase “watches, yachts, private jets, vacation homes, high-end collectibles and rare artwork.” Zhi was still at large as of Tuesday. He could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Strategies for funding US crypto reserves Since Trump established the strategic BTC and digital asset reserves for the US government in March through executive order, the stockpile has grown to potentially include about 198,000 Bitcoin, worth more than $22 billion at the time of publication. The addition of the crypto forfeiture in Zhi’s case could result in a reserve totaling about 325,000 BTC, or $36 billion at current prices. In addition to crypto seized through civil forfeiture and criminal cases, some White House advisers and lawmakers have proposed alternative methods for adding to the US reserves. In November, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested that the government could convert some of its gold reserves into Bitcoin. The US holds more than 8,100 metric tons of gold at facilities like Fort Knox. However, it’s unclear if Trump’s executive order has the authority to allow the government to purchase Bitcoin or other tokens through the sale of other assets. Some advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that there were budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin for the reserve, but congressional approval may be required. At the time of publication, the price of Bitcoin was $112,738, according to data from Nansen. Magazine: Review: The Devil Takes Bitcoin, a wild history of Mt.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped power the asset manager to a strong quarter of earnings and revenue, underscoring the continued momentum behind its crypto-related products as institutional demand accelerates. The iShares platform, which includes more than 1,400 ETFs globally, attracted a record $205 billion in total net inflows in the third quarter, according to the company’s quarterly financial statement . Those inflows fueled a 10% increase in organic base fee growth during the quarter and 8% growth over the past 12 months, chairman and CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. Fink reiterated that BlackRock is “always preparing for the future,” highlighting ongoing offerings in emerging sectors such as technology, data analytics and digital assets. The firm’s digital asset ETFs recorded $17 billion in net inflows during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $34 billion. As of September, total crypto assets under management (AUM) stood at nearly $104 billion, representing about 1% of BlackRock’s overall assets. Since the beginning of the year, BlackRock’s digital asset ETF AUM has grown significantly due to strong net inflows. Source: BlackRock The results come amid the breakout success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has generated $25 million more in fees than BlackRock’s second-most profitable ETF and was approaching $100 billion in net assets in early October. IBIT was among the first wave of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in early 2024. Later that year, BlackRock launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — a spot Ethereum ETF which, after a slow start, gained traction in 2025 to become the third-fastest fund to reach $10 billion in assets. Overall, robust inflows contributed to a strong quarter for BlackRock, which reported total AUM of $13.46 trillion, a 17% increase from a year earlier. Both earnings and revenue exceeded analysts’ expectations for the period.

Part of the momentum may also reflect the “debasement trade,” as investors seek refuge from the US dollar’s steepest decline in five decades, amid widening fiscal deficits, trade uncertainty and persistent inflation. As Cointelegraph recently reported , Bitcoin’s correlation with gold has strengthened, suggesting that an increasing number of investors view BTC as a store of value and inflation hedge alongside traditional safe-haven assets.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Senate Democrats submitted a counterproposal to the crypto framework bill last week. Industry advocates are concerned that this will stall progress on the legal clarity for the blockchain industry. The proposal, which has not yet been released publicly, would reportedly impose a number of rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Among these is a supposed “restricted list” for DeFi protocols deemed too risky. Industry commenters are concerned that the measures are made in bad faith. Digital Chamber vice president of policy and government affairs Zunera Mazhar said that the law gives “sweeping authority, narrowly defines decentralization, and treats front ends like financial intermediaries.” Following the proposal, Senate talks on the bill have reportedly halted until Democrats and Republicans can agree on a markup session. Amid an industry outcry, further work on the crypto framework bill has slowed to a crawl. The CLARITY Act passed the House in September and moved to the Senate, where it became the RFIA. Source: Legiscan Crypto framework law progress stalls The recent proposal from Democratic senators in the Senate Banking Committee has put a pause on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), which has already been beset with delays. The committee initially released a draft of the RFIA in July. Committee Chair Tim Scott said in August that he expected the law to pass by the end of September. In August, Scott noted nominal bipartisan support for the bill, which he said was necessary for it to pass. The deadline has come and gone, and now it looks like making the RFIA a reality will only get more difficult. Each side has accused the other of holding up negotiations as the issue descends into partisan mudslinging. According to Punchbowl News, which first acquired a copy of the Democrats’ proposed amendments, further meetings regarding RFIA are now on hold. Catherine Fuchs, Scott’s staff director, reportedly said, “Until we have an agreed upon date for markup we are going to pause any further meetings.” Markup is a process where legislators go through a bill, review each line item and propose amendments to change, add or delete language. Jacques Petit, communications director for Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego, blamed Republicans for the legislative standstill. He claimed that they asked for input from Democrats, “then turned around and leaked our proposal and pretend to be surprised that our parties have policy differences.” “Democrats have shown up ready to work but our Republican counterparts are crashing out.” He said, “Their demand to set a markup date before text is agreed to is like setting a wedding date before the first date. It’s nonsensical.” Republicans criticized Democrats for leaking communications to the press. Scott’s spokesperson, Jeff Naft, said, “Leaking private communications during market structure negotiations should tell you everything you need to know ... It shows one side is more focused on political narratives than serious work.” Scott wanted the bill to pass by Sept. 30. Source: Mario Nawfal Whether the bill can progress in the committee seems to depend on which side wavers: either Republicans return to the table, or Democrats agree to a markup. Notably, the Banking Committee is not the only Senate body discussing the crypto framework bill. As of Oct. 6, some talks were reportedly still underway in the Senate Agriculture Committee over the commodities-related aspects of the bill. There, Senator Cory Booker took over bipartisan talks with the office of Senator John Boozman. It’s currently not clear what, if any, progress has been made. Blockchain industry outcry The Democrats’ proposal was met by an outcry from the crypto industry. The main complaint was the Democrats’ proposal of a “restricted list,” overseen by the US Treasury, for DeFi protocols deemed “too risky.” Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger said it would “effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development, and other decentralized applications in the United States.” She further added that the current language would make it impossible for decentralized applications to be compliant. It would also drive development offshore, Mersinger said. Mazhar said that the Democrats’ plans were simply outdated. “It’s heavy handed, ineffective, and risks pushing innovation offshore instead of addressing real risks.” Instead, she proposed that DeFi regulations focus on targeting illicit finance chokepoints and “developing risk-based oversight.” Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer of investment fund Variant, said that Democrats were not negotiating in good faith. “A group just sent a counter-proposal to the RFIA and it is deeply unserious. These Senators claim to be pro-crypto, but what they propose is basically a crypto ban,” he stated . Chervinsky did not shy from hyperbole; he said the proposal was “less a regulatory framework and more an unprecedented, unconstitutional government takeover of an entire industry. It’s not just anti-crypto, it’s anti-innovation, and a dangerous precedent for the entire tech sector.” Alexander Grieve, vice president of government affairs at investment fund Paradigm, recalled the crypto industry’s boogeyman, former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Gary Gensler. “If the market structure bill landed on developer protections at a midpoint between where the bill currently is, and where this new proposal planted a flag, that midpoint would be worse than anything Gensler cooked up,” he said. With senators at a standstill on crypto and on the funding of the US government as a whole, the future of the landmark bill for the crypto industry becomes less certain. Partisan divides are growing starker than ever, and it seems the blockchain industry won’t be spared. The offices of Senators Booker, Scott and Gallego did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment as of publishing time.

Metaplanet’s market to Bitcoin NAV (mNAV) — a ratio between the company’s value and its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings — dropped below 1 on Tuesday, reaching 0.99 for the first time on record, according to official data. The metric has dropped by more than seven points since mid-June, as the Metaplanet stock (3350) lost 75% of its value, falling from a peak of 1,895 Japanese yen ($13) per share to $3.20 on Tuesday, according to TradingView. Metaplanet’s mNAV dropped below 1 after the company halted Bitcoin buying for the past two weeks, with its most recent BTC acquisition announced on Sept. 30. Why is mNAV important? Unlike traditional net asset value (NAV), mNAV is a ratio of enterprise value to Bitcoin NAV, designed to help investors gauge how the market values the company relative to its underlying BTC holdings, according to a mNAV page on BitcoinTreasuries.NET. In mNAV, enterprise value is defined as the market capitalization of all Class A and Class B shares, total debt and the notional value of perpetual preferred shares, minus the company’s cash balance.

Does Metaplanet’s mNAV drop signal a failure? Market observers have expressed mixed reactions to Metaplanet’s enterprise value falling below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. “Metaplanet trading below its Bitcoin NAV doesn’t signal failure: it reveals a market that still misunderstands Bitcoin treasury models,” Melanion Capital’s CEO Jad Comair told Cointelegraph. Source: HODL15Capital “It’s the same kind of misunderstanding that led investors to short Tesla in its early years: they saw a car company instead of an energy revolution,” Comair said, adding: “The same will happen here. Once markets grasp the reflexive power of Bitcoin treasuries, these discounts will flip into persistent premiums."" Smartkarma’s equity analyst Mark Chadwick said that Metaplanet’s mNAV dynamics highlight an ongoing cooling of the Bitcoin treasury trend. “I still see this crypto treasury stock decline as a popping of a bubble,” Chadwick said, adding that long-term Bitcoin bulls may see Metaplanet’s discount as an opportunity to buy.

Over the last six months, weekly fundraising fluctuated from $150 million to $2.9 billion, underscoring the volatility of venture activity in the crypto space. October’s sudden surge represents a significant breakout. The bumper fundraising came as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $126,000 on Oct. 6, and just before a massive liquidation event that crashed the crypto markets on Friday. Weekly fundraising data. Source: Cryptorank Blockchain services dominate weekly funding rounds Cryptorank data showed that blockchain services dominated last week’s fundraising activity. Out of the 28 rounds recorded from Oct. 6 to Sunday, 12 were for blockchain service providers, making it the most active sector. Centralized finance (CeFi) projects followed with six rounds, while the remainder went to blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming and social ventures. This reflects a broad but service-driven trend in the crypto investment landscape. Pantera Capital was the most active investor last week, participating in four deals: two in blockchain services, and the others in CeFi and social ventures. Over the past year, Coinbase Ventures has remained the most active player overall, with 73 investments across multiple sectors. Animoca Brands followed with 63 deals, while Binance-affiliated YZi Labs completed 38 . Amber Group and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto accelerator (a16z CSX) rounded out the top tier with 37 each.

On Oct. 6, BTC reached a new all-time high of $126,000, according to CoinGecko. The new BTC high was linked to the asset moving from centralized exchanges and into self-custody, institutional funds and digital asset treasuries . However, the celebrations didn’t last long. On Friday, US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on China , causing BTC prices to drop below $110,000. Bitcoin proceeded to plunge by $16,700, marking a 13.7% correction in less than eight hours. The sharp drop to $105,000 wiped out 13% of futures open interest in Bitcoin. The crash also resulted in almost $20 billion in liquidations , led by the decentralized perpetuals exchange Hyperliquid.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED America’s federal government has entered its third week of shutdown, leaving as many as 16 exchange-traded funds (ETF) awaiting approval should the shutdown continue into November. Most of the US government came to a standstill on Oct. 1 when the Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a funding agreement. This has caused agencies, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which approves ETF applications, to run with only essential staff. The crypto industry was set for a flood of ETFs in October , with the SEC set to make their final decisions on at least 16 crypto ETFs, and a nother 21 applications filed in the first eight days of October, but the shutdown has left everything in limbo, with deadlines passing and no action taken . No end to the US government shutdown in sight There is no clear timeline for when the shutdown may occur, as both sides remain in a stalemate over competing demands. Among the Republicans’ demands are rolling back spending to reduce the growing national debt, which has grown to over $37.8 trillion, or roughly $111,000 per person in the US, while increasing funding to areas such as border enforcement. Meanwhile, the Democrats oppose the cuts to healthcare and also want an extension of expiring tax credits, which make health insurance cheaper, among other demands. The Senate isn’t scheduled to hold any votes until Tuesday, and the House is out of session, leaving no immediate avenue to end the shutdown. For it to end, Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, must pass legislation to fund the government through separate bills, or a continuing resolution, which is a temporary measure to keep the government funded at current levels while negotiations continue. Once the bills pass, President Donald Trump can sign them into law, and the shutdown will end. The Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress; however, in the Senate, they are short of the votes needed to pass spending bills without Democratic support. The shutdown is the 11th in US history and the first since the December 2018 to January 2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and remains the longest on record to date.

The Trump administration is reportedly “leaning toward a pardon” for Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2024 and spent four months in prison. According to New York Post columnist and Fox correspondent Charles Gasparino, sources close to Zhao said that Trump insiders believe the case against CZ was “pretty weak, and certainly not something that merited a felony charge and jail time.” “Trump… is leaning toward a pardon (consider the source), which could set the stage for CZ’s return to the crypto exchange since he remains Binance’s largest shareholder,” he said, citing people close to Zhao. Source: Charles Gasparino Under the Trump Administration, the White House has taken a friendlier approach to crypto, with regulators dismissing long-running enforcement actions, advancing legislation aimed at regulating the industry and also pardoning three BitMEX founders, including Arthur Hayes, and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht . Changpeng Zhao seemingly unaware of any deal Zhao responded to Gasparino on Friday but didn’t confirm if he knew anything about a potential pardon. In May, the former Binance exec confirmed on the Farokh Radio podcast that he had officially applied for a pardon after seeing media reports that he had already sought one. “Thank you, Charles. Great news if true. Minor correction, there were no fraud charges. I believe they (the DOJ under the last administration) looked very hard for it, but didn’t find any. I pleaded to a single violation of the Banking Secrecy Act (BSA),” Zhao said. Source: Changpeng “CZ” Zhao “I believe I am the only person to ever be sentenced to jail in US history for a single violation of BSA, with no other charges, no prior history. Thank you for the coverage,” he added in another post. Binance and Zhao didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A White House official told Cointelegraph: “The White House does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of pardons. The President, not anonymous sources, is the final decider on pardons.“ Zhao pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in November 2023 as part of a deal Binance reached with US authorities, which saw the exchange pay a $4.3 billion fine , and Zhao was fined $50 million. He was also forced to step down as CEO , served four months in prison, and was prohibited from working at Binance as part of his plea deal. Trump’s crypto ties could hamper pardon Gasparino said a final decision is expected soon. Still, a potential hurdle for the pardon going forward is concerns from “Some in the White House,” about the “optics of a pardon given the president’s business interests in crypto, so the situation is obviously fluid.” President Donald Trump and his family’s ties to the crypto sector, through ventures such as his memecoin and decentralized finance protocol World Liberty Financial, have raised conflict-of-interest concerns before . “Keep in mind these things often drag on longer than expected, and this president does have more pressing matters that he’s dealing with, like getting the Israeli hostages returned, ending the broader Gaza conflict, as well as the one in Ukraine, on top of tariffs and a trade deal with China,” Gasparino added. Related: Polymarket odds on CZ presidential pardon surge after X profile change CZ enforcement action is an aftershock from FTX collapse At the same time, Gasparino, citing Eleanor Terrett, one of the hosts of the Crypto In America podcast and a former FOX Business reporter, said top crypto executives, some with ties to the White House, think CZ’s charges were a result of an overreaction from lawmakers after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX. SBF, once the leader of the $32 billion FTX exchange, is serving a 25-year prison sentence for seven felony charges related to the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research in November 2022. “CZ wasn’t accused of fraud like SBF, and many industry players see his jail sentence as the result of regulators — still with egg on their faces, post-FTX — making an example out of anyone in crypto who operated in or around the US,” Terrett reportedly said.

The study found that digital assets currently make up about 7% of institutional portfolios, a figure expected to climb to 16% by 2028. Most holdings are concentrated in digital cash (stablecoins) and tokenized versions of listed equities or fixed income, with respondents allocating about 1% of their portfolios to each and asset managers maintaining greater exposure. Source: State Street While stablecoins and tokenized assets comprise the bulk of current holdings, cryptocurrencies have delivered the most substantial returns. Bitcoin topped the list for 27% of respondents as the best-performing asset, followed by Ethereum at 21%. The report also noted that private assets remained the top bet to benefit first from tokenization, and that most institutions surveyed expect digital assets to become mainstream within the next decade; yet they remain cautious about how fast adoption will grow. Just over half (52%) of respondents expect 10% to 24% of all investments by 2030 to be made through digital or tokenized instruments, while only 1% foresee most investments moving entirely onchain. The survey, produced with Oxford Economics, polled over 300 institutional investors on how they’re using digital assets, AI and blockchain — and where they’re allocating capital next.

Cointelegraph spoke to legal and regulatory experts to find out. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Paul Atkins wants to cement his vision for the crypto markets before political tides shift again in Washington. As the new chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he’s moving quickly to “future-proof” SEC policies,  a push that could define how much freedom the crypto industry enjoys after President Donald Trump leaves office. In a conference hosted by the Managed Funds Association in New York on Tuesday, Atkins said the SEC would work quickly to adopt rules that could “future-proof” his agenda. He specifically referred to removing or weakening regulations on public and private markets, both of which could impact the cryptocurrency industry after Trump or Atkins leaves. “We have, I think, an amazing opportunity to get together and, in a can-do spirit, kind of create something that’s lasting,” said Atkins on US regulators collaborating. “My main concern is to future-proof this against future potential changes. What we have to do is to get things implemented, get things agreed, and then let the market work […]” On collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC chair said: “As we go forward, especially with digital assets, the one thing that I am trying to warn people about is we can’t have two fortresses on either side of a no man’s land strip, because that no man’s land strip right now is littered with the corpses of would-be products that have gotten killed in the crossfire of the two agencies over the years.” Paul Atkins (right) speaking in New York on Tuesday. Source: Managed Funds Association Even before the US Senate confirmed Atkins as SEC chair in April, then-acting Chair Mark Uyeda had significantly changed the agency’s approach to digital assets by closing several investigations and cases against crypto companies and establishing a crypto task force under Commissioner Hester Peirce. Under Atkins, the commission changed listing standards for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reportedly weighed allowing stocks to trade on the blockchain, considered abandoning the agency’s quarterly reporting requirements, and held a roundtable with the CFTC to “harmonize” regulations. “[T]he momentum behind digital assets is difficult to reverse,” Andrew Forson, president of Canada-based DeFi Technologies, said in response to an email from Cointelegraph. “US policy, even amid differing leadership philosophies, has increasingly aligned traditional capital markets with decentralized finance.” Could a future US president undo all the SEC’s work with the stroke of a pen? Though Atkins has broad authority to propose and support rules and policies favoring the crypto industry, he has been closely aligned with the current administration, based on public statements. As SEC chair, he can direct the agency to pursue enforcement actions and adopt policies. Shortly after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigned in January, the agency softened its approach to crypto enforcement, dropping many years-long investigations and cases. Some might question whether a future US president who could be more anti-crypto or neutral on the technology would be able to quickly reverse Atkins’ agenda, as the SEC is doing for many of Gensler’s positions. “It would be difficult for a new SEC chair to fully reverse Chair Atkins’ proposed policies,” Forson told Cointelegraph. “However, a future administration could layer on additional reporting requirements and compliance burdens—effectively slowing progress and innovation. This would echo the early days of ICOs, when overregulation stifled legitimate token offerings.” Forson added: “If a less crypto-friendly administration took over, existing instruments would likely be grandfathered in, but new entrants would face significant headwinds. Regulatory shifts might temper innovation, but they can’t dismantle the ecosystem that’s already firmly established.” Related: US government shutdown enters day 1: How is the SEC still functioning? David B. Hoppe, a technology and media attorney and the founder of Gamma Law, offered a slightly different perspective, saying that future SEC chairs couldn’t unilaterally roll back the agency’s rules and regulations. However, they could change the SEC’s “internal priorities” established by Atkins and shift resources back to pursuing enforcement cases and investigations against crypto companies. “With a vote of the SEC commissioners, the future chairperson could also reverse official policies of the SEC announced under Mr. Atkins,” Hoppe told Cointelegraph. “This could mean a return to the SEC’s previous posture that crypto projects presumptively implicate securities laws. Although nonbinding, SEC policy statements communicate SEC rule interpretations and enforcement priorities and can significantly affect market participants.” What about SEC regulations changed by Congress? A market structure bill currently working its way through the US Senate could also significantly change SEC regulations and, should it pass and be signed into law, require another act of Congress to change or undo. However, according to Hoppe, some of the changes under the market structure law would likely face fewer challenges. “[A]ny regulations adopted by the SEC and CFTC to implement the market structure law would be much easier to amend or withdraw, as they would need only go through the standard notice-and-comment process (or other applicable procedure),” Hoppe told Cointelegraph. “The SEC or CFTC could, in the future, decide to reinterpret the provisions of the market structure law and amend or withdraw regulations accordingly.” Cointelegraph reached out to Atkins for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. As of Thursday, the US government had entered the ninth day of a shutdown caused by lawmakers’ inability to reach an agreement on a funding bill. The SEC continues to operate on reduced staff and operations, but Atkins said on Tuesday that the agency was “not slowing down” amid the shutdown.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED This year, Texas’ legislature passed a law to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, opening the door for other cryptocurrencies in the future. According to the original sponsor of the bill, Ether could be the next reserve asset. Speaking to Cointelegraph on Thursday, Texas state Senator Charles Schwertner discussed the implementation of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve bill signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in June. Though the text of the bill allows Texas to hold other cryptocurrencies in a “special fund outside the state treasury,” Bitcoin was the only one to meet the requirements at the time of passage. “I’m really interested to see the speed at which they establish the reserve and how it acts from a returns standpoint,” said Schwertner. ”If Ethereum maintains its market cap over 24 months, I think it’s reasonable and prudent to give direction that Ethereum could be added to the cryptocurrency [reserve].” Source: Charles Schwertner Under the law to establish and administer a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, for any cryptocurrency to qualify as a reserve asset, it must “have an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over the most recent 24-month period.” Bitcoin, with a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, meets this threshold. Related: Massachusetts Bitcoin reserve bill gets lukewarm response at hearing By comparison, Ether ( ETH ) has only maintained a market cap of more than $500 billion twice: for about a month in 2021 and off and on from August to October this year. On Friday, the price of ETH and its market cap dropped sharply , with the latter reaching about $494 billion at the time of publication. How does Texas’ law differ from those passed in other states? While many US states have rejected or otherwise failed to advance similar bills establishing crypto reserves, Arizona and New Hampshire signed legislation into law in 2025. Arizona’s fund includes crypto seized through criminal forfeiture, while New Hampshire’s law allows the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in crypto with a market cap of more than $500 billion. “We’re the only state that actually put sovereign money, taxpayer money, toward the reserve,” said Schwertner, adding: “We took the full punch [establishing] a reserve as well as the money behind it.” According to the senator, the state comptroller is looking into the implementation of the law, including custodians for the reserve’s holdings. Under the conditions of the law, any custodian must be a “state or federally chartered financial institution” or other entity regulated in Texas. Texas’ law, as well as others under consideration, followed the federal government under US President Donald Trump establishing both a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile” in March. The executive order laid out policies to use confiscated crypto to fund the reserve, but officials later added that there were “budget-neutral ways” to buy BTC. Magazine: ‘Help!

As crypto-native platforms bring tokenized assets onchain and asset managers open new channels for exposure, “the distinction between traditional and onchain finance continues to blur.” The result is that digital assets are “becoming a standard part of diversified portfolios,” Feng said.

What makes Bitcoin a reserve candidate? Amid gold breaking new historic highs in inflation-adjusted terms, Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist Marion Laboure highlighted a set of parallels between the assets, potentially making Bitcoin an appealing store of value.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin advocate Roger Ver, known to many in the crypto industry as “Bitcoin Jesus,” has reportedly reached a deal with the US Department of Justice that may allow him to avoid prison time. According to a Thursday New York Times report, Ver’s lawyers reached a tentative agreement with US authorities that would require the Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate to pay $48 million in taxes he owed from his crypto holdings. The Justice Department charged Ver with mail fraud and tax evasion in April 2024, seeking to extradite him from Spain to stand trial. The New York Times reported that Ver has ties with figures connected to the administration of US President Donald Trump, including hiring lawyers who previously worked for the president. He also reportedly paid $600,000 to political consultant Roger Stone, a Trump adviser, to lobby for changes to US tax laws. The reported deal followed a series of regulatory and legal moves under the Trump administration that signaled a softer stance on cases involving digital assets. At the time of publication, the tentative agreement did not appear on the public docket for Ver’s case in the US District Court for the Central District of California. Related: Roger Ver’s Trump pardon plea: ‘Lawfare’ victim or tax evader? The initial indictment alleges that Ver falsely reported on tax forms related to his crypto holdings. He and two of his companies, MemoryDealers and Agilestar, allegedly held about 131,000 BTC in 2014. The DOJ said he attempted to evade paying taxes on his assets by renouncing his US citizenship and later becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. “Even though Ver was not then a US citizen, he was still legally required to report to the IRS and pay tax on certain distributions,” said the Justice Department in April 2024. Spanish authorities arrested Ver after his US indictment in 2024, but he posted bail in a matter of days. Since that time, Ver’s lawyers have been challenging Spanish authorities attempting to extradite him to the US and fighting the charges in federal court. Seeking a presidential pardon After Trump won reelection in 2024, many crypto users speculated that the president might issue a pardon for Ver. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the darknet marketplace Silk Road and one of the first individuals to receive a pardon from Trump, called for leniency in Ver’s case. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes,” said Ulbricht in February. “Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” As of Thursday, Ver’s X profile linked users to a petition for Trump to pardon him. His website also had an open letter asking the US government to end the prosecution, claiming it was a “retaliatory action” for his advocacy of Bitcoin.

In a Thursday notice, Bybit said approval from the UAE financial regulator would allow the exchange to offer its global products and services to the region. Authorities in Austria granted the company similar licensing approval in May, and the exchange registered in India in February after briefly suspending its service and paying a $1-million fine over compliance violations. “Receiving the full Virtual Asset Platform Operator License from the SCA is a testament to Bybit’s unwavering commitment to building trust through compliance and transparency,” said Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou. “The UAE has emerged as a global leader in digital asset regulation, and this recognition underscores the strength of our security and governance standards.” Many crypto companies seeking regulatory approval for different regions of the UAE often have to rely on a patchwork approach to offer services to residents.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Oct. 9 at 7:15 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include a response from Peter Durant. A bill intended to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve for the US state of Massachusetts received a tepid response to its first legislative action in eight months. In a Tuesday hearing of the Massachusetts legislature’s Joint Committee on Revenue, state Senator Peter Durant testified regarding the bill he sponsored, “an Act relative to a Bitcoin strategic reserve.” The lawmaker largely went over the logistical details of the bill, including having the state treasury use up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund to invest in crypto and allowing any Bitcoin ( BTC ) or digital assets seized by state authorities to be added to a reserve. “This creates a prudent diversification tool, ensuring full transparency, oversight, and risk management without mandating any action,” Durant said. State Senator Peter Durant speaking at a Tuesday hearing. Source: Massachusetts Legislature After opening for questions from the committee, no one in attendance responded to the BTC reserve proposal. It’s unclear what the chances are for the bill passing in the legislature, given Democrats have a supermajority in the state’s House of Representatives and Senate and control the governorship. Durant is a Republican. “We’ve been having great conversations with our colleagues about the possibility of bringing Bitcoin to Massachusetts, and we’re working hard to move this forward alongside others who have filed similar legislation,” Durant told Cointelegraph. “Lawmakers have been engaged and open during the process, and we’re focused on continuing to educate every stakeholder.” According to the Massachusetts lawmaker, the committee now has 60 days from Tuesday to advance the bill or send it for additional review, suggesting there will likely be movement by early December. Related: Massachusetts to hold hearing to consider Bitcoin reserve bill In addition to Durant, the committee heard testimony from Dennis Porter, CEO of the Bitcoin advocacy organization Satoshi Action Fund. Porter and the group have petitioned many state lawmakers to act to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Speaking on Durant’s bill and similar legislation proposed by state Representative Christopher Worrell and state Senator Barry Finegold — i.e., “an Act allowing for fiscal resilience through strategic investment in stable digital financial assets” — Porter described the potential move as “bipartisan in nature,” describing the work other US states had done to pass similar bills. “There is no state better suited to lead than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a historic financial hub that pioneered America’s first mutual fund and remains at the forefront of financial innovation,” said Porter. Other US states are more bullish on creating crypto reserves Durant’s bill, introduced in February, was one of many state-level legislative paths to creating strategic BTC or digital assets reserves amid the federal government’s establishment of them through US President Donald Trump’s March executive order. Texas, Arizona and New Hampshire signed bills into law regarding crypto reserves. However, many other US states in which lawmakers proposed similar legislation have rejected or delayed passage, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Montana.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Over the last two months, at least 31 crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications were filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, 21 of which were filed in the first eight days of October. This ETF wave comes amid increased optimism in crypto markets, which have seen impressive gains over the last month. The price action has started a familiar pattern of markets booming in October, dubbed “Uptober.” This also coincides with major geopolitical developments that can affect the finance sector. In France, Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has stepped down after just 26 days, rocking the country’s financial markets. In the US, a government shutdown has put federal business on pause, including ETF considerations at the SEC. Despite these headwinds, analysts are optimistic about the next month for crypto, with the “floodgates” set to open for crypto ETFs. “Uptober” launches with 21 crypto ETF filings The crypto-friendly pivot at the SEC has led to a slew of filings from fund managers seeking to list crypto-related ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that, as of Aug. 29, some 92 crypto exchange-traded products were awaiting the SEC’s decision . At the time, NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci said , “Look at all the crypto ETF filings out there... […] What I mean by ‘crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon.’” That number has grown over September and the first week of October. Cointelegraph Research found that over the past two months, at least 31 crypto-related ETFs were filed. This includes 21 ETFs filed by REX Shares and Osprey Funds on Oct. 3. Other funds include iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, Bitwise Hyperliquid ETF, Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust and Bitwise Avalanche ETF — all filed in September. August saw ETF submissions containing a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, including Chainlink ( LINK ), Solana ( SOL ), Sei ( SEI ) and even Official Trump ( TRUMP ), the president’s memecoin. Interest in crypto ETFs has been growing. Iliya Kalchev, a dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo, previously told Cointelegraph that the US Federal Reserve’s cutting interest rates has sparked new demand for Bitcoin ETFs . Demand for hedge assets further spiked after Oct. 1 , when the US federal government shut down. Congressional Democrats could not agree with the funding proposal of President Donald Trump’s administration. As a result, thousands of federal employees are on furlough, and the doors of many federal agencies are shut. Related: What to expect as US government shutdown enters second week More than $5 billion flowed into ETFs tracking cryptocurrency in the week ending Oct. 4. “This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty,” said CoinShares head of research James Butterfill. Analysts have pointed to a number of signals that Uptober is set to continue. Onchain data provider CryptoQuant said that the relatively low stablecoin supply ratio shows there is more stablecoin buying power in the market. It said , “Rising stablecoin supply is a strong tailwind during bull markets.” ETFs get simplified standards, but the shutdown could drag on The US government shutdown has put ETF approvals on pause. The SEC is one of the many federal agencies that will be operating on a skeleton crew until lawmakers can agree on a budget. Still, October could shape up to be a big month for ETFs. Several ETFs have October deadlines, and as of Sept. 17, the SEC has approved a new, simplified set of standards for crypto ETF approvals. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said , “This approval helps to maximize investor choice and foster innovation by streamlining the listing process and reducing barriers to access digital asset products within America’s trusted capital markets.” Grayscale head of research Zach Pandl told Cointelegraph on “ Byte-Sized Insight ” last week that, with these new rules, there are many cryptocurrencies that are “ready to go into an ETF wrapper as far as the SEC is concerned.” Still, there’s no guarantee that the shutdown will be settled anytime soon. Democrats oppose Republicans’ proposed cuts to healthcare spending and want to see previous cuts to Medicaid reversed. Trump, who has already made cutting government spending a defining trait of his administration, has hinted that he will use the shutdown to institute further rollbacks on government spending. In the past, government shutdowns rarely lasted longer than a few days. But Trump has already shown that he is especially willing to ride out a shutdown. His first administration holds the record for the longest US government shutdown in history, at 35 days, costing the federal government $5 billion and delaying $18 billion in federal spending. While lawmakers continue to meet and debate spending proposals, it’s anyone’s guess as to when the SEC could open its doors again and make a decision on crypto ETFs. But when that does happen, observers are bullish that ETFs representing a more diverse range of cryptocurrencies will hit markets.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Bank of France called on the EU to give its markets regulator direct supervision over major crypto firms, warning that fragmented oversight could threaten the bloc’s financial sovereignty. Speaking at the ACPR-AMF Fintech Forum in Paris on Thursday, Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau said the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should be given the mandate to directly oversee crypto-asset issuers under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. “I also advocate, along with the president of the AMF, for European supervision of crypto-asset issuers, carried out by ESMA,” he said, adding that it may guarantee the consistent application of rules and reduce risks. Villeroy de Galhau said relying on national regulators risks creating uneven enforcement across the EU at a time when crypto companies are scaling rapidly in the region. Bank of France says stablecoins threaten the EU’s monetary sovereignty He added that direct oversight by the Paris-based ESMA would prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure that key players are held to the same standards no matter where they are based. “The implementation of MiCA is a decisive step forward,” he said. “But its effectiveness requires a more unified approach if we are to protect European investors and maintain a level playing field.” Villeroy de Galhau also used the speech to talk about the growing threat of dollar-backed stablecoins. He said that MiCA’s current allowance for the multi-issuance of stablecoins is a regulatory weakness. Under the framework, companies can issue the same token both inside and outside the EU while maintaining only partial reserves. He said that stablecoins could weaken the euro and could lead to an uncoordinated multiplication of private settlement solutions. This would increase the region’s dependence on non-European and unregulated entities. Other officials have echoed concerns over multi-issuance stablecoins. On Sept. 19, Bank of Italy Deputy Governor Chiara Scotti warned that the model could undermine financial stability and should be restricted. She noted that while multi-issuance structures may improve liquidity and scalability, they also create significant legal, operational and stability risks, particularly when issuers are based outside the EU. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the EU body tasked with monitoring systemic risks, has also taken aim at multi-issuance stablecoins . On Oct. 1, the ESRB adopted a recommendation to prohibit the practice both within the bloc and in other jurisdictions. While not legally binding, the move increases pressure on EU policymakers to regulate stablecoin operations more closely. Stricter regulations can reduce arbitrage risks Villeroy de Galhau said the answer lies in completing the European regulatory framework: “This framework would benefit from much stricter regulation of the multi-issuance of the same stablecoin from inside and outside the European Union, to reduce arbitrage risks in times of stress.” Villeroy de Galhau’s comments came as the European Commission develops plans to shift supervision of financial sectors, including crypto, from national regulators to ESMA. On Monday, the ESMA’s chair, Verena Ross, said the reform would build a more integrated and globally competitive landscape for the EU. Related: BoE signals flexibility on stablecoin caps amid industry pushback: Report Passporting issues spur calls for unified supervision Under the EU’s MiCA framework, licensed crypto firms can utilize a feature known as passporting, which enables them to obtain authorization in one EU member state and enjoy license validity across all member states. The purpose of this feature is to create a single market for crypto providers, thereby lowering barriers to entry and preventing duplicate applications. While the passporting system is designed to streamline access to the market, in practice, it risks exposing gaps if national regulators fail to meet their obligations. In July, ESMA criticized Malta’s licensing process after finding out that the country’s financial watchdog only partially met expectations in authorizing a crypto company. This raised concerns that weak supervision in one country could lead to a ripple effect across the EU. On Sept. 15, France’s securities regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), also raised concerns about regulatory enforcement gaps tied to the MiCA framework. The regulator said it may consider refusing the validity of the passporting feature.

Takaichi’s election may have a “material impact on the perception and governance of digital assets within the country,” according to Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at tokenization platform Brickken. In previous public positions, Takichi has expressed support for “technological sovereignty,” including the “strategic development of digital infrastructure, including blockchain technology,” Fabrega told Cointelegraph. “From a legal perspective, this suggests that her administration may adopt a posture that is not only permissive but potentially proactive in promoting the digital economy.” Fabrega added that Takaichi’s political positioning may strengthen “Japan’s commitment to legal certainty in the crypto space” and renew interest in the country as an innovation-friendly crypto hub.

Takaichi may “refine” existing token definitions, crypto regulatory frameworks Experts say Takaichi’s administration could bring greater clarity to token classifications under Japan’s Financial Services Agency. The FSA currently distinguishes between payment tokens, securities and utility tokens, each with different regulatory requirements. Takaichi’s leadership will likely focus on the “refinement and expansion” of existing categories, particularly related to custody, tokenized financial instruments and investor protection standards, according to Fabrega. “We may see the consolidation of supervisory tools related to Anti-Money Laundering, the implementation of more strict disclosure requirements for public offerings involving digital assets, and a more structured framework for the authorization of platforms engaging in token issuance or trading.” Japan has embraced crypto regulations since Mt. Gox collapse Japan has been developing its crypto regulatory framework since at least 2016, when the FSA amended the Payment Services Act (PSA) to establish a regulatory regime imposing the first registration requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. This came in response to the meltdown of Mt. Gox , which exposed pressing regulatory gaps in the country. In April 2017, the new amendments took effect, requiring exchanges to register with the FSA and comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer standards. In April 2018, crypto exchanges came together to form the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), prior to the FSA granting the JVCEA self-regulatory status in October 2018. In June 2022, Japan’s parliament introduced new regulations allowing licensed financial institutions to issue fiat-backed stablecoins, requiring issuers to fully back stablecoins with reserves held domestically in yen. In April 2023, Japan’s LDP issued a white paper outlining strategies for Web3 and blockchain adoption , recommending adjustments in tax policies and exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval frameworks. In June, the FSA proposed reclassifying crypto assets as traditional financial products. Expected to take effect from 2026, this will subject cryptocurrencies to a new tax regime.

SoftBank’s PayPay acquired a 40% equity stake in the Japanese subsidiary of global crypto exchange Binance, with Binance Japan becoming an equity-method affiliate of PayPay as of September 2025, the company announced on Thursday. Following the acquisition, PayPay and Binance Japan plan to launch integrated services to allow Binance clients to buy and sell crypto assets using the cashless payment service PayPay Money. “Through its continued evolution from a cashless payments business into a digital financial platform, PayPay will strive to deliver new value to users while contributing to the advancement of Japan’s financial infrastructure,” the company said in the announcement. PayPay user base is 70 million “PayPay has been advancing digital finance through smartphones in collaboration with our group companies in the financial sector, which share strong synergies with payments,” PayPay corporate officer Masayoshi Yanase said in a joint statement on Thursday. “By investing in Binance Japan, which is a part of Binance, the world’s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume, we will provide Binance users with solutions that combine the convenience and security of PayPay,” the exec added. PayPay’s investment in Binance Japan builds on its significant milestones in the market. Launched by SoftBank in 2018, PayPay surpassed 70 million users for the first time in July 2025.

BVNK declined to disclose the size of Citi’s investment or its current valuation. However, co-founder Chris Harmse told CNBC that its valuation now exceeds the $750 million reported at its last funding round. The firm was already backed by major investors, including Coinbase and Tiger Global. “You’re seeing an explosion of demand for building on top of stablecoin infrastructure,” Harmse told CNBC. He said BVNK’s strongest momentum comes from the US, its fastest-growing market over the past 18 months, as regulatory clarity improves. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , a US bill providing clearer oversight of stablecoins, has spurred institutional confidence, he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Asset manager Bitwise’s decision to set a 0.20% fee on its amended US-based Solana ETF application, which now includes staking, may be a sign of how competitive the product could get among ETF issuers, according to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “Thought we’d see higher first, need war to get this low,” Balchunas said in an X post on Wednesday. “They prob figured it’s gonna end up there anyway, so just do it now,” he said, adding it is a “veteran Terrordome move right there.” Bitwise amended its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, updating the proposed Solana ( SOL ) ETF to include an annual management fee of 0.20% and the addition of a staking feature. The fee places it in the middle of the range for most crypto ETFs, which typically fall between 0.15% and 0.25% . “Low fees have a near-perfect record of attracting investors, so it’s a good sign for inflow potential,” Balchunas explained. Crypto ETF fee speculation has been around for some time Ahead of potential crypto ETF launches, industry attention has often focused on which ETF issuers would offer the lowest fees. Solana is up 6.11% over the past 30 days, trading at $227 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap The competition was especially fierce before the US debut of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, when asset manager VanEck waived all fees and later extended the waiver through January 2026 for up to $2.5 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) set an annual sponsor fee of 0.15%. On July 2, the US’s first Solana staking ETF, the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), ended its debut trading day with $12 million in inflows. The annual management fee for the SSK is 0.75%. BlackRock’s silence on Solana ETF However, Balchunas pointed out that Bitwise’s proposed offering is cheaper, has better tracking, and is 100% physically backed by Solana's spot assets. “SSK is riddled with tracking issues like a futures ETF. It trails spot Solana by 12% — although it got better in the past month,” he said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin is currently clear of “overbought conditions” and is set to track a steady path upward despite hitting a new all-time high on Monday, according to analysts. Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a peak high of over $126,000 on Monday, which places it “roughly halfway through its four-year price cycle,” CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain said on Wednesday. “Despite this strong performance, technical indicators suggest the price is still moving within a stable range far from the overbought conditions that typically precede historical peaks,” it added. Bitcoin shows signs of “upward momentum” Arab Chain stated that Bitcoin “appears to be in a phase of balanced upward momentum,” with its 30-day moving average, which is the average closing price over the last 30 days, being just under $116,000, “suggesting a steady upward trend without sharp deviations.” It added that Bitcoin’s 30-day standard deviation, or the variability of its returns, was also “relatively low at $4,540, reflecting a compression in volatility, a condition that typically precedes strong price movements, especially upward, if supported by renewed liquidity inflows.” Bitcoin’s growth ratio has been on an upward trajectory since May 2024. Source: CryptoQuant The analysts said Bitcoin tends to reach its cycle peak up to 600 days after its halving , where mining rewards are slashed 50%, and if that pattern continues, Bitcoin is now “within the critical window that has previously led to major bull market tops.” “Stars are aligned” for record Q4 ETF inflows: Bitwise It comes as Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan predicted on Tuesday that inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) will surge in the fourth quarter. Hougan said that Bitcoin’s surging price is one of the reasons that inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs “will set a record” in Q4, and will “pull in more money in 2025 than they did in their record-setting first year, when they attracted $36 billion.” The ETFs have attracted $22.5 billion in inflows in the first nine months of the year, which would put them on pace to end 2025 with approximately $30 billion in flows. “Here’s a hot take: I’m not worried,” Hougan said. “From where I sit, the stars are aligned for a very strong Q4 for flows — more than enough to push us to a new record.” He said the “most fundamental” reason he predicts high flows to cap 2025 is that he’s “bullish on Bitcoin returns for Q4.” Gold (black) and Bitcoin (orange) ETF inflows by year since launch. Source: Bitwise “Although it’s a bit counterintuitive, higher prices often spur greater demand for Bitcoin ETFs as the media, companies, and everyday investors pivot their attention to Bitcoin,” Hougan said. He added that in every quarter where Bitcoin saw double-digit growth, inflows to Bitcoin ETFs also saw “double-digit billions in inflows.” “Debasement trade,” platform approvals put Q4 at a good start Hougan said his prediction is also based on a wider range of investors being able to invest in the ETFs as wealth managers open up to them and as traders look to invest in assets that do well with a weakening US dollar. Related: Bitcoin rebounds toward range highs as data highlights ‘real liquidity’ Wall Street will look for “The Debasement Trade” to buy well-performing assets as the US dollar weakens, Hougan said, and gold and Bitcoin have both performed well so far this year. “Why does this matter? Because when advisers sit down with their clients for their annual review, they want their year-end printouts to show that they hold the most successful investments. There’s only one way to do that: By buying gold and Bitcoin.” That debasement trade will be helped by some of the largest wealth managers “finally changing” to open up their platforms to Bitcoin ETFs, Hougan said. He noted a Morgan Stanley report released earlier this month that guides 16,000 advisers said they could “flexibly allocate to cryptocurrency as part of their multiasset portfolio” with a suggested allocation of up to 4% for “risk-tolerant investors.” Hougan added that Q4 “is off to a great start” with the ETFs taking in $3.5 billion in net flows in the first four trading days. “We have 64 more days to get another $10 billion,” he said. “I think we’ll do that and then some.” Trade Secrets: Bitcoin to see ‘one more big thrust’ to $150K, ETH pressure builds # Bitcoin Add reaction","Jesse Coghlan Oct 09, 2025 Bitcoin looks far from overbought as ‘stars are aligned’ for ETF surge Bitwise’s Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin ETF inflows will hit a record in Q4, as analysts say Bitcoin still has room to run despite recently hitting a peak.",CoinTelegraph,2025-10-09 02:11:06+00:00,2025-12-07 12:34:04.386587,2025-12-07T19:17:58.429575

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The UK government has finally lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes, citing a maturation of the industry and a greater understanding of digital asset products. In an announcement on Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) outlined that retail investors can now access crypto ETNs via FCA-approved exchanges based in the UK A crypto exchange-traded note is a debt product that allows an investor to gain exposure to a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. These types of products are essentially traded similarly to any other security, with underlying crypto held securely by regulated custodians. “Since we restricted retail access to crypto ETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood. In light of this, we’re providing consumers with more choice, while ensuring there are protections in place,” said David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, as part of the announcement. The crypto ETN ban initially went into effect in January 2021, with the FCA stating that it considered “these products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.” It also argued that there was a “lack of legitimate investment need” for these crypto products at the time. The latest move by the FCA marks a significant shift in tone, as the government has gradually warmed to the crypto space over the past few years. The country is awaiting the rollout of a comprehensive framework following a government leadership change in July. As part of the announcement, the FCA also said that its ban on “retail access to cryptoasset derivatives will remain in place,” adding that it will continue to keep an eye on “market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments.” How crypto ETNs differ from other investment products.

Market set for growth with crypto ETNs A recent research report by IG Group predicts the UK crypto market could grow by up to 20% following the relaunch of crypto ETNs. The report based this prediction on its own research that found that “30% of UK adults would consider investing in crypto via ETNs,” with the main appeal being the “perceived safety and regulatory oversight” offered by these products. “This represents a significant potential uplift from current levels of crypto ownership — 12%, according to the FCA’s latest study, and 25% according to IG’s new study.” Magazine: EU’s privacy-killing Chat Control bill delayed — but fight isn’t over # Law # Government # Investments # Adoption # UK Government # Regulation Add reaction","Brian Quarmby Oct 09, 2025 UK lifts ban on crypto exchange-traded notes as ‘market has evolved’ The UK has lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes, with analysts predicting the move could grow the UK crypto market by 20%.",CoinTelegraph,2025-10-09 02:08:42+00:00,2025-12-07 12:34:13.814752,2025-12-07T19:17:58.429575

In a Wednesday CNBC interview, Steil said Republicans’ plan for passing legislation to establish what they called regulatory clarity for the digital industry was still on track. Party leaders in the Senate pledged to have the chamber’s version of the bill signed into law by 2026, but as the government shutdown entered its eighth day, many in the industry have voiced concerns. “I think we still have an opportunity to get CLARITY across the line by the end of the year,” said Steil, adding: “I’m hopeful that as we come on the other side of the shutdown that we have an opportunity to hit the ground running and have the Senate move forward quickly.” He added: “If the Senate chooses to use the House text as their base text, I think what we have is an opportunity to get this bill still done, signed into law by the end of the year.” Steil’s remarks came amid a vote on a stopgap measure failing to pass in the Senate, likely extending the shutdown another day.

In a Tuesday vote of 51 to 47, the Senate confirmed McKernan to the US Treasury, serving under Secretary Scott Bessent. Though the US government has been shut down since lawmakers failed to pass a bill extending funding beyond Sept. 30, Congress can essentially continue to operate. McKernan, nominated to the Treasury by US President Donald Trump in June, has previously suggested opposition to debanking policies in the government, but did not explicitly tie the alleged practice to any association with digital assets.

Government shutdown slows regulatory, legislative progress The US government shutdown entered its eighth day on Wednesday. A Republican-led stopgap bill to fund the government failed by 54 to 45 in the Senate, not meeting the 60-vote threshold to pass. Republicans currently hold a slim majority in the chamber and need Democratic votes to reopen the government. Democrats have asked for an extension of healthcare subsidies and a reversal of cuts from a July funding bill. Though members of Congress may continue to confirm Trump’s existing nominees and pass legislation, the shutdown has effectively halted exchange-traded fund approvals at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Announced on Wednesday, the new Square Bitcoin offering allows merchants to accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments and automatically convert a portion of their sales into BTC. Square is waiving processing fees through 2026, with a 1% transaction fee set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2027. Merchants can store their Bitcoin in a dedicated wallet accessible through Square’s existing dashboard, where they can also buy, sell or withdraw the asset. The service is available only to US sellers, excluding New York State, and is not open to international merchants. The rollout could mark a significant step toward broader crypto adoption, as more than 4 million merchants use Square’s payments platform, according to company data. Square’s embrace of Bitcoin isn’t surprising. The company had previously announced plans to roll out the service by 2026 , and the move aligns with Block Inc.’s broader crypto strategy and the vision of CEO Jack Dorsey , a longtime Bitcoin advocate.

Operating under New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) oversight, the company is rolling out a custody framework to meet soaring institutional demand for regulated digital asset infrastructure spanning ETFs, digital asset treasuries (DATs) and token launches, according to a Wednesday announcement. “Regulatory compliance and security are non-negotiable,” said Matt Walsh, founding partner at Castle Island. “Fireblocks Trust Company delivers on both fronts with their qualified custodian status and robust operational controls,” Walsh added. Fireblocks Trust Company’s infrastructure is built on Fireblocks’ cold storage technology and connects directly with a network of more than 2,400 financial institutions, according to the company. “Fireblocks Trust is different because we are hyper-focused solely on custody and collateral management solutions, designed to bolster our clients’ businesses rather than compete with them,” Adam Levine, CEO of Fireblocks, told Cointelegraph.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) opposed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act ( RFIA ), arguing in a letter to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that it would pose significant risks to workers and the financial system. The bill’s treatment of crypto assets “poses risks to both retirement funds and to the overall financial stability of the US economy,” said AFL-CIO director Jody Calemine. He added that the bill will enable the crypto industry to “operate in wider and deeper ways in our financial system without sufficient oversight or meaningful safeguards.” Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand originally introduced the RFIA in 2022 and revised it earlier this year. The Senate Banking Committee is developing the bill as an alternative approach to regulating crypto with a different scope and regulatory emphasis, rather than advancing the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill the House passed in July. Protecting workers and pensions Calemine said that the AFL-CIO “supports efforts to update regulatory regimes to better protect workers from the volatility of this asset class,” but the bill only “provides the facade of regulation.” Related: Crypto execs meet US lawmakers, discuss Bitcoin reserve, market structure bills He added that rather than insulating workers from the crypto volatility, the bill “would increase workers’ exposure by greenlighting retirement plans like 401(k)s and pensions to hold this risky asset.” More systemic risks Calemine also claimed that the taxpayer-backed Deposit Insurance Fund, which protects consumer bank deposits, would be subject to greater risk if banks were allowed to custody crypto.

Fees higher than spot Bitcoin ETF, but “pretty normal” Spot Bitcoin ETFs fees average between 0.15% and 0.25%, according to Ledger, compared to Canary’s 0.95% fees, but Balchunas said that is not out of the ordinary. “My take on the 95bp fee. It’s pricey vs spot BTC, but pretty normal to see higher fees for areas that are new to being ETF-ed and increasingly niche,” he said. Source: Eric Balchunas However, he also noted that if the LTC and HBAR ETFs attract decent flows and interest from investors, other issuers could try to undercut Canary and compete with cheaper products. Issuers’ “spaghetti cannon” 3x ETFs despite shutdown The US government might be in shutdown, but companies are still filing for new ETFs , according to Balchunas and Seyffart, with a focus on funds with 3x leverage. A 3x ETF is a fund that tracks a wide variety of assets, such as stocks, and applies leverage to gain three times the daily or monthly return. In the past, the SEC has rejected or failed to approve high-leverage crypto ETFs due to concerns about investor protection related to volatility and complexity. ETF issuer Tuttle Capital filed for 60 new 3x ETFs. Another ETF issuer, GraniteShares, also submitted a batch of ETF applications holding a range of assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ). ProShares also entered the fray with a slew of filings. Source: Eric Balchunas Balchunas estimates there are close to 250 3x ETF filings, and said issuers “spaghetti cannon” so many at once because they “make good money.” “The degens are hungry and fee insensitive,” he added. “Powerful combo in capitalism.” Balchunas explained that such ETFs create a 2x leverage using swaps, but will then “use options to target an extra 1x.” Goverment shutdown leaves ETF approvals in limbo The crypto industry was set for a flood of new crypto ETFs in October , with the SEC supposed to make their final decisions on 16 crypto ETFs throughout the month. Related: Altcoin ETFs face decisive October as SEC adopts new listing standards New listing standards were also announced in September , which could expedite spot crypto ETF approvals, as each application would no longer need to be assessed individually, reducing approval timelines.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Bank of England (BoE) appears to be softening its stance on proposed limits to corporate stablecoin holdings, with plans to introduce exemptions for companies that may need to maintain larger reserves of fiat-pegged assets, according to a Bloomberg report published Tuesday. Citing people familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg reported that the BOE’s reconsideration comes amid intense industry backlash and growing international competition, particularly from the United States, which is moving toward clearer regulation through the GENIUS Act , which was signed into law in July . The BoE had initially proposed caps on stablecoin holdings — 20,000 pounds (about $27,000) for individuals and 10 million pounds for companies — citing concerns over systemic risks posed by widely used tokens such as USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ). The restrictions were intended to help the central bank maintain control over the money supply, protect consumers and prevent excessive reliance on privately issued digital currencies. While those limits may be workable for traditional businesses, crypto-native companies may argue that such caps would constrain their operations, given their need to hold substantial stablecoin reserves for trading and liquidity management. Bloomberg reported that the BOE may therefore consider granting exemptions to these firms. As Cointelegraph reported , Simon Jennings of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council argued that the proposed stablecoin limits “simply don’t work in practice.” Source: GC Cooke BOE Governor Andrew Bailey had previously warned that privately issued stablecoins could threaten financial stability and undermine governments’ ability to conduct monetary policy. However, in remarks last week, Bailey struck a more conciliatory tone, acknowledging that stablecoins may represent a useful innovation capable of coexisting within the broader financial system. The BOE’s evolving stance highlights the UK’s ongoing effort to balance financial stability with competitiveness in the fast-growing stablecoin sector. In this area, some critics say the country has been slow to act compared with peers like the US and the European Union. Related: Bank of England governor says stablecoins could reduce reliance on banks UK lags in stablecoin race The global stablecoin market has surged to a valuation of roughly $314 billion, with the vast majority of tokens pegged to the US dollar. By contrast, pound-pegged stablecoins remain a tiny fraction of the market — less than $1 million in total circulation, according to DefiLlama data cited by Bloomberg. The stablecoin market is surging, without the British pound. Source: DefiLlama Despite the UK’s cautious approach and concerns over market risk, Tether co-founder Reeve Collins said it’s only a matter of time before all fiat currencies exist in stablecoin form, possibly as soon as 2030. “All currency will be a stablecoin. So even fiat currency will be a stablecoin. It’ll just be called dollars, euros, or yen,” Collins said at the Token2049 conference in Singapore. In Collins’ view, stablecoins are poised for widespread adoption thanks to their ease of use and their role in supporting the growth of tokenized assets, a sector increasingly attracting traditional financial capital.

Update Oct. 8, 6:47 am UTC: This article has been updated to add information from VARA’s website. Dubai’s crypto regulator fined 19 companies for operating without licenses, signaling a continued push to strengthen oversight and protect investors. On Tuesday, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had issued financial penalties and cease-and-desist orders against 19 companies found to be operating outside its regulatory perimeter. VARA said the sanctions were part of its ongoing effort to safeguard the emirate’s fast-growing digital asset ecosystem and limit the risks of unlicensed crypto activities. “Enforcement is a critical component of maintaining trust and stability in Dubai’s Virtual Asset ecosystem,” said VARA’s Enforcement Division. “These actions reinforce VARA’s mandate: to ensure that only firms meeting the highest standards of compliance and governance are permitted to operate.” Dubai regulator cracks down on unlicensed companies The enforcement actions followed a series of investigations into unauthorized operations. According to the regulator, the companies were penalized for offering crypto-related services without approval and for violating VARA’s marketing rules. In 2024, VARA tightened its rules on crypto marketing , requiring disclaimers to be placed on promotional materials. The regulator also required prior authorization before promoting products and services to citizens and residents. At the time, VARA CEO Matthew White said this compels virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to “deliver their services responsibly,” adding that it fosters transparency and trust in the market. All penalized entities were directed to immediately cease their operations and halt any promotion of unlicensed services in or from Dubai. These entities were also fined from 100,000 to 600,000 dirhams ($27,000–$163,000), depending on the seriousness and scope of each violation. “Unlicensed activity and unauthorised marketing will not be tolerated,” said VARA’s Enforcement Division. “VARA will continue to take proactive measures to uphold transparency, safeguard investors, and preserve market integrity.” The move follows a similar enforcement action in October 2024 , when the regulator fined seven unlicensed crypto entities between $13,600 and $27,200 and issued cease-and-desist orders for breaching its rules. How VARA determines fines and punishments for violators Nicholas McNicholas, the head of enforcement at VARA, told Cointelegraph that VARA looks at several factors to determine the scale of the fine, including the nature, seriousness and impact of the violation. For marketing fines specifically, VARA also looks at all the circumstances of the advertising, including the level and scale of targeting Dubai customers. This includes any information that may indicate the firm in question is licensed. When asked about the details of the sanctioned companies, McNicholas told Cointelegraph that all the relevant details are already published on VARA’s website. Cointelegraph reviewed VARA’s website and found 38 entities listed, with 31 sanctions issued in 2025 alone. The most recent entries date back to August, and the list does not clearly identify which firms were part of the latest enforcement action. He also said that VARA has an independent appeal process. “The firms that were fine had a chance to appeal to VARA prior to the action being published,” McNicholas said.

The regulator reiterated that only VARA-licensed entities are allowed to offer crypto services in or from Dubai. The move followed other regulatory developments in the region. On Aug. 7, VARA partnered with the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) to unify the country’s approach to crypto regulations. When asked if the recent enforcement action was related to the SCA partnership, VARA told Cointelegraph that the agency collaborates closely with the Securities and Commodities Authority and, where necessary, “will take joint action in accordance with the partnership.” Magazine: Avalanche in deal with ETF giant, yuan stablecoin ‘fake news’: Asia Express # Blockchain # Cryptocurrencies # UAE # Government # Dubai # Regulation # Policy Add reaction","Ezra Reguerra Oct 07, 2025 Dubai regulator cracks down on 19 unlicensed crypto operators Dubai’s crypto regulator sanctioned 19 companies for unlicensed operations and marketing violations, imposing fines of up to $163,000.",CoinTelegraph,2025-10-07 10:11:16+00:00,2025-12-07 12:37:48.787026,2025-12-07T19:18:06.726014

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Many US federal employees have been furloughed, and others continue to work without pay, since lawmakers failed to pass a stopgap measure to fund the government last week, and the shutdown is expected to continue. As of Monday morning, there had been no reported deal between Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress to stop the shutdown and return operations to normal, including activities at financial regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Senate is scheduled to hold a vote on a continuing resolution to fund the government at 5:30 pm ET, but at the time of publication, it was unclear whether the measure would have enough support to pass. The crux of Democrats’ position in the budget standoff is healthcare, with lawmakers demanding that any spending bill include a reversal of cuts from a July budget measure. Regarding the impact on the digital asset industry, the SEC said that it would operate “under modified conditions” within an “extremely limited number of staff” until a funding bill is passed, restricting its ability to review crypto exchange-traded fund applications. The CFTC, with only one commissioner who is currently serving as acting chair, is also operating with restrictions and limited staff. “The US government shutdown […] can damage the crypto industry by disrupting the SEC and CFTC, which are vital to global digital asset markets,” Przemysław Kral, CEO of crypto exchange Zondacrypto, said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “While the immediate impact might seem contained, their reduced operational capacity risks stalling innovation and reducing investor confidence, particularly in a region already playing catch-up with crypto regulation,” Kral said. Related: Bitcoin rally to $125K fueled by US gov’t shutdown, macro factors: Analysts Until the government returns to normal operations, it is unlikely that the Senate will be able to consider a bill to establish a digital asset market structure, nor would US President Donald Trump nominate replacements for CFTC commissioners. The White House withdrew the nomination of Brian Quintenz as CFTC chair last week amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both Trump donors and supporters. Crypto users are betting on a prolonged shutdown A variety of bets on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket show that many users are predicting a long — but not historically long — shutdown. Trump holds the record for a 35-day government shutdown during his first term, over his push to build a US-Mexico border wall. On Kalshi, a bet on the length of the shutdown predicted a 69% chance of it lasting more than 15 days, with 41% for more than 25 days. Polymarket gave users a 24% chance at the time of publication that the current shutdown would be the longest in US history, but a 72% chance that it would end after Oct. 15.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Plume Network, a layer-2 blockchain designed to host real-world assets (RWAs), has registered as a transfer agent with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a move that bolsters its ability to bring traditional financial instruments onchain and streamline the issuance of tokenized securities. The company announced its registration on social media, saying the step supports its broader mission of migrating securities markets onto blockchain infrastructure. Transfer agents traditionally handle critical back-office functions for securities issuers, including maintaining shareholder registries, recording ownership transfers and managing corporate actions. Plume said its registration allows it to replicate and automate those roles onchain, “linking cap tables and reporting directly to SEC and DTCC systems,” a reference to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which is responsible for settling securities transactions. The registration marks a significant step toward bridging traditional finance and decentralized systems , giving Plume regulatory standing to manage tokenized securities under US law. Source: Plume Network As Cointelegraph previously reported , Plume raised $20 million in a December funding round backed by Brevan Howard Digital, Huan Ventures and Galaxy Ventures to accelerate development of its tokenization platform. Since then, the company says it has facilitated more than $62 million in tokenized assets through Nest Credit, its institutional-focused fixed-income vault. Related: Tokenizing stocks of DATs compounds investor risk: Crypto execs Institutional RWAs: filling the adoption gap While industry sources peg the tokenized RWA market at about $33 billion, reflecting the total value of financial assets now represented onchain, Plume Network co-founder and CEO Chris Yin says institutional participation remains far smaller than the headline figure suggests. “These things move incredibly slowly — you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin told Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Dubai, likening the current stage of RWA development to the early years of Bitcoin ( BTC ) adoption. Yin noted that most tokenized activity today centers on US Treasury bills and select private credit products — a trend consistent with broader industry data showing RWAs primarily concentrated in low-risk, yield-bearing instruments. According to Yin, the true potential of tokenization lies beyond short-term yield products. “It provides an entirely new mechanism for fundraising, investor engagement, and cap table transparency,” he said. Source: WatcherGuru Venture capital investment across crypto and blockchain has slowed sharply in recent quarters, but RWA infrastructure continues to attract funding , suggesting investors view it as one of the sector’s most promising real-world applications. Beyond fixed income, interest in tokenized equities is also building. Platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken have introduced tokenized stock products, while the SEC is considering rule changes that could allow traditional equities to be tokenized and traded on crypto exchanges — a shift that could accelerate institutional adoption.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Union’s markets regulator is preparing to expand its authority to cover cryptocurrency exchanges and other operators, a move officials say would better align oversight with the bloc’s newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Verena Ross, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times that the European Commission is developing plans to shift supervision of several financial sectors, including crypto, from national regulators to ESMA. Ross said the reform would help build “a more integrated and globally competitive” EU financial landscape. The proposal aims to address “continued fragmentation in markets” and move closer to a unified capital market across Europe, she said. Under the current MiCA regime, licences for crypto-asset service providers are issued by national authorities rather than a central EU body. Smaller member states have so far led the rollout. Lithuania granted its first license to discount brokerage Robinhood Europe earlier this year, while Malta has authorized major exchanges, including OKX and Crypto.com. In Luxembourg, Bitstamp and Coinbase have also secured MiCA licences. Source: ESMA Comms Ross argued that delegating supervision to individual countries has created inefficiencies, forcing each national authority to build its own expertise and oversight systems. ESMA has also raised concerns about inconsistent licensing standards, including a July review that criticized elements of Malta’s authorization process. Established in 2011 in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, ESMA was created as part of the European System of Financial Supervision to harmonize financial regulation across the bloc. MiCA, which came into force beginning in June 2024 , is the EU’s landmark crypto law designed to create a unified framework for digital asset issuers and service providers across all 27 member states. Related: Malta regulator fines OKX crypto exchange $1.2M for past AML breaches MiCA faces pressure over cross-border “passporting” Efforts by ESMA to streamline and unify crypto regulation are colliding with growing tensions among EU member states over the so-called “passporting” rule — a key feature of the MiCA framework that allows companies licensed in one country to operate across the entire bloc without needing separate approvals. In a recent Cointelegraph podcast , Jerome Castille, head of compliance at CoinShares, said the biggest challenge facing MiCA is ensuring consistent implementation across all member states. Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, a policy group advocating for pro-industry regulation, said the problem stems from having “27 different national competent authorities supervising the same regulation.” She argued that this fragmented approach risks undermining MiCA’s core objective of harmonization. The passporting system has sparked controversy among some of the bloc’s largest markets. France, for example, is reportedly considering restrictions on crypto companies that are licensed elsewhere in the EU but wish to operate within its borders — a move critics say could breach single-market principles. “From what we’ve seen, blocking passporting under MiCA is technically possible, though it comes with significant legal complexity,” Markezic said.

In a Monday report, Standard Chartered’s Global Research department said it expects global stablecoin adoption to accelerate as payment networks and other core banking activities shift to the non-bank sector. As stablecoins gain traction in emerging markets (EM), Standard Chartered noted that users might utilize stablecoins to access what’s essentially a US dollar-based account. “Stablecoin ownership has been more prevalent in EM than DM, suggesting that such diversification is also more likely in EM,” Standard Chartered said.

More vulnerable countries and their current deposit bases. Source: Standard Chartered Two-thirds of stablecoin supply already in emerging markets Standard Chartered said the biggest disruption from stablecoins will likely come from emerging markets, where access to US dollars has historically been limited. By providing consumers with digital, 24/7 access to a USD account, stablecoins represent lower credit risks than deposits held in their local banks, as the United States’ GENIUS Act requires them to be fully backed by dollars. Standard Chartered said this dynamic increases the risk of deposit flight from EM banking systems to crypto alternatives. The bank estimated that two-thirds of the current stablecoin supply is already in savings wallets across emerging markets. Standard Chartered added that countries with high inflation, weak reserves and large remittance inflows are at risk of deposit flight into stablecoins. Related: GENIUS Act could mark end of banking rip-off: Multicoin exec Stablecoins to combat inflation amid failing local currencies Venezuela is often seen as an example of this shift from banking to stablecoins . With annual inflation between 200% and 300% and the bolivar’s value collapsing, citizens have turned to stablecoins both as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. Merchants now widely denominate prices in USDt ( USDT ) — often referred to locally as “Binance dollars,” reflecting how stablecoins have supplanted the bolivar in daily commerce amid hyperinflation. In Chainalysis’ 2024 crypto adoption report, Venezuela ranked 13th and showed a 110% increase in crypto usage throughout the year. Small family stores, large retail chains and shows across the country are accepting crypto through platforms like Binance and Airtm. In 2023, crypto accounted for 9% of the $5.4 billion in remittances sent to Venezuela. Beyond Venezuela, countries like Argentina and Brazil are also increasingly substituting savings into USDC ( USDC ) and USDT to dodge inflation. Many businesses in these countries have started to accept stablecoins as a form of payment. According to Fireblocks, stablecoins comprise 60% of crypto transactions in Brazil and Argentina.

By enabling staking across its Ethereum and Solana products, Grayscale said it aims to give investors exposure to the “long-term value accrual of these networks while maintaining the funds’ core objectives.” Source: Grayscale “Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver,” said Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors.” Both ETHE and ETH are exchange-traded products registered under the Securities Act of 1933, not the Investment Company Act of 1940, the latter being the regulatory framework used for traditional mutual funds. This makes them structurally different from ETFs governed by the 1940 Act, though they follow the same legal framework used for spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ETFs. “ETHE and ETH hold digital assets; however, an investment in ETHE and ETH is not a direct investment in digital assets,” Grayscale said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Cryptocurrency investment products recorded their highest-ever inflows last week, as the US government shutdown fueled a rally in spot crypto markets. Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $5.95 billion of inflows in the week ending Friday — the largest ever seen — CoinShares reported on Monday. “We believe this was due to a delayed response to the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] interest rate cut, compounded by very weak employment data [...], and concerns over US government stability following the shutdown,” CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said. The record inflows came amid an overall bullish trend in crypto markets, which led to Bitcoin ( BTC ) registering a new historic high above $125,000 on Saturday. Bitcoin ETPs break records With inflows reaching $5.95 billion, crypto ETPs surpassed the previous $4.4 billion record from mid-July by 35%. Unlike the previous record inflows, which were almost equally distributed between Bitcoin and Ether ( ETH ), the latest gains were heavily dominated by BTC, with Bitcoin funds attracting a record-breaking $3.6 billion. “Despite prices closing in on all-time highs during the week, investors did not choose to buy short investment products,” CoinShares Butterfill noted.

New ETF launches despite shutdown-triggered delay concerns Crypto ETPs’ historic inflow records came amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shutting down operations last week , sparking concerns over potential delays of highly anticipated exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals this October.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Galaxy Digital, a crypto investment firm founded by former Fortress Investment Group president Michael Novogratz, is launching the GalaxyOne platform, offering exposure to both crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) markets. Galaxy Digital has launched GalaxyOne, a platform combining exposure to yields on fiat cash with trading cryptocurrencies and equities, the company announced on Monday. Targeting individual investors in the United States, GalaxyOne offers a 4% annual percentage yield (APY) on cash deposits, in addition to an 8% APY through Galaxy Premium Yield, which is offered exclusively to accredited investors. “We’ve spent years building institutional-quality infrastructure to serve the world’s most sophisticated investors. Now, we’re extending that edge to individuals,” Novogratz said. “Full spectrum financial services provider” Originally developed under the name Fierce — which Galaxy acquired in 2024 — GalaxyOne is designed for individual investors seeking exposure to both TradFi and digital markets. According to Novogratz, GalaxyOne advances Galaxy’s mission of becoming a “full spectrum financial services provider” that builds regulated and accessible products for all market segments.

Race for yields The launch of GalaxyOne comes amid growing demand for yields, or income on an investment over a specific period, particularly in the cryptocurrency industry. According to Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins will eventually force banks to offer customers yields on deposits to remain competitive. “As technology reshapes how people invest, expectations are clear: more yield, easier access from a single platform, and opportunities that extend beyond traditional boundaries,” GalaxyOne director and Galaxy managing director Zac Prince said, adding: “GalaxyOne delivers exactly that: a unified opportunity to earn yield on cash, trade  crypto, and access US equities, all supported by Galaxy’s financial discipline, institutional  oversight, and professional team trusted by some of the world’s most sophisticated institutions.” GalaxyOne does not support yields on stablecoins at launch, as the US GENIUS Act explicitly banned issuers from offering yield-bearing stablecoins .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin breached a new all-time high over the weekend, prompting analysts to call for a renewed accumulation phase that could fuel a rally to $150,000 before the end of the year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) set a new all-time high above $125,700 , and its market capitalization briefly crossed the $2.5 trillion milestone for the first time in crypto history , Cointelegraph reported earlier on Sunday. The rally was supported by multiple macroeconomic factors, including the recent US government shutdown — the first since 2018 — which some analysts say has renewed interest in Bitcoin’s store-of-value role. In the past, similar conditions have led to “major price milestones,” according to Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at digital asset banking group Sygnum Bank. The US government shutdown has “renewed discussion around Bitcoin’s store-of-value role, as political dysfunction underscores interest in decentralised assets,” Dori told Cointelegraph. “At the same time, the broader environment — characterised by loose liquidity conditions, a service-led acceleration in the business cycle, and narrowing underperformance relative to equities and gold — has drawn attention to digital assets,” he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The next wave of stablecoin adoption may not be led by people at all. Paxos Labs’ co-founder says AI agents could become the “X-factor,” instantly shifting liquidity to the most efficient issuers and turning market fragmentation into an advantage. With clearer regulations around stablecoins passing in the United States , the stablecoin market has surged past $300 billion , becoming one of crypto’s central narratives. However, fragmentation across issuers and jurisdictions remains a challenge. As new entrants join an increasingly diverse field — from dollar-backed leaders like Tether and Circle, to synthetic assets like Ethena , and PayPal’s PYUSD , which targets consumer payments — questions have arisen over whether fragmentation could pose a problem to the industry. Bhau Kotecha, co-founder and head of Paxos Labs, told Cointelegraph that “fragmentation is a double-edged sword.” As different models compete, as well as issue stablecoins that are aligned with their businesses, it risks “creating liquidity silos and user confusion, which can hinder adoption.” However, he believes that AI agents — autonomous programs that can make decisions and perform tasks like trading or moving funds without human input — could solve the issue. AI agents, he said, will “switch instantly” to whichever stablecoin offers the best economics. “That means fragmentation isn’t necessarily a deterrent; it can actually become a market-level optimizer, where AI ensures liquidity flows to the most efficient issuers. Over time, this could compress fees and force issuers to compete on fundamentals.” Related: All currencies will be stablecoins by 2030: Tether co-founder The rise of AI agents in crypto Kotecha is not the only one highlighting the importance of AI agents for stablecoin adoption. In a Sept. 2 Bloomberg interview at Goldman Sachs’ Asia Leaders Conference in Hong Kong, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said AI agents are set to become the primary users of stablecoins, fueling a surge in transaction volumes. In the “not-so-distant future,” AI agents could use stablecoins to handle everyday purchases, he said, citing a grocery agent that knows your diet, preferences and budget and can automatically fill your cart. He added that these agents would likely rely on stablecoins instead of wire transfers or payment apps like Venmo, leading him to expect “an explosion of stablecoin transactions” in the coming years.

In a Thursday notice, the FDIC said its board would consider a notice of proposed rulemaking “regarding prohibition on use of reputation risk by regulators.” Though the agenda did not explicitly mention debanking concerns tied to digital assets, acting FDIC chair Travis Hill has previously criticized regulators for using “reputation risk” as justification to prevent some banks from engaging in crypto activities, such as allowing clients to send funds to exchanges. US President Donald Trump used the term in an August executive order “guaranteeing free banking,” claiming that having regulators access reputation risk could result in “politicized or unlawful debanking.” The order did not specifically mention digital assets. Before Trump took office and signed the executive order , many in the crypto industry alleged they were denied access to US banking services as part of an orchestrated push by authorities due to their ties to digital assets. Court documents made public in December as part of a Freedom of Information Act request with the FDIC showed the regulator asked some institutions to “pause all crypto asset-related activity” in 2022.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to soon reverse a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors enacted in 2019. According to an Aug. 1 notice, the UK watchdog will lift a ban on retail access to crypto ETNs starting on Wednesday, provided they are traded on an “FCA-approved, UK-based investment exchange.” Unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are still banned in the UK for retail investors, ETNs represented debt securities tied to crypto and not backed by any underlying assets. With the lifting of the ban looming, companies with operations in the UK have been weighing in on what the regulatory change could mean for retail investors. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, is reportedly looking into ways to offer its iShares Bitcoin exchange-traded product to prepare for retail trading on or after Oct. 8. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, whose company’s European operations are headquartered in London, said on X that he was “excited to be able to serve more investors in our home market in Europe at long last.” “Until now, the UK has been an outlier on ETNs,” Ian Taylor, board adviser to the digital assets trade association CryptoUK, told Cointelegraph. “We hope this move will improve consumer protections and we will continue to make the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly-regulated derivative products.” According to an August notice from the FCA, any asset manager planning to offer trading of ETNs to UK retail investors had to have them listed on a “Recognised Investment Exchange.” The decision followed consultations with companies, trade associations, and consumer groups. Related: UK allows retail access to crypto ETNs, signals push to become crypto hub Companies’ offerings reportedly delayed Companies with operations in the UK, like CoinShares and Bitwise, will be able to offer exchange-traded products with exposure to digital assets. However, the Financial Times reported that retail investors could have to wait up to a week before being able to trade, in part due to the FCA only beginning to accept prospectuses on Sept. 23, two weeks before lifting the ban. The regulator will likely have to review offerings from companies and follow up with any potential comments or concerns. As of Friday, the FCA had made no moves suggesting that it was planning to lift a similar ban on ETFs or crypto derivatives for retail investors. “While several respondents called for retail access to cryptoasset ETFs, ETFs marketed to UK retail investors are unable to invest directly into cryptoassets under our current regulatory framework for funds,” said the FCA in its August notice lifting the ETN ban. “This framework would need to be updated before retail investors could access cryptoasset ETFs.” In contrast, spot cryptocurrency-tied ETFs have been available for trading in the US since being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2024. The agency is currently operating with restrictions after US lawmakers failed to pass a bill to fund the government beyond Oct. 1, limiting its ability to review any crypto ETFs.

Retail traders remain cautious after $307 million in liquidations, keeping leverage muted. Solana ETPs surpassed $500 million AUM, reinforcing institutional accumulation trends. Solana ( SOL ) futures have entered a pivotal phase, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) open interest (OI) reaching an all-time high of $2.16 billion as SOL price rebounded 23% to $235, from a local bottom at $195 on Friday. The timing was notable as institutional volumes surged on CME after SOL established its bottom, demonstrating how market participants are positioning ahead of the SEC’s Oct. 10 SOL ETF decision.

Source: CoinGlass From a structural standpoint, this creates a balanced but bullish setup. Institutions are layering into positions with conviction, while retail hesitation helps prevent froth from building up. With CME volumes surging at the point of SOL’s local bottom, the data implies that accumulation by stronger hands is occurring rather than speculative blow-off positioning. At the same time, inflows into Solana exchange-traded products (ETPs) have reinforced institutional appetite. Total Solana ETP net flows crossed $500 million in assets under management this week, led by the Solana Staking ETF (SSK) from REXShares, surpassing $400 million, while the Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) broke above $100 million AUM .

Given institutional flows, this scenario gains weight if ETF speculation remained a dominant narrative. In both cases, the lack of aggressive retail leverage works in SOL’s favor, reducing downside risk from cascading liquidations. The more institutions continue to anchor CME OI growth, the more likely any correction is shallow rather than trend-breaking. For now, SOL futures painted the picture of a market transitioning from fear into cautious accumulation, with institutions leading the charge.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED October 2025 is shaping up to be a big month for crypto markets, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces final deadlines on 16 exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Unlike past waves, many of these proposals go beyond Bitcoin and Ether, targeting altcoins like Solana, XRP and Litecoin . This week on “Byte-Sized Insight,” we explore what makes this round of filings different, how the SEC’s stance may be shifting and what the potential approvals could mean for both investors and the broader crypto market. A new SEC era On Sept. 17, the SEC approved a set of “generic listing standards” for exchange-traded products tied to spot commodities, including digital assets. Analysts say the move may dramatically simplify the ETF approval process, reducing the need for case-by-case rule changes that had long slowed crypto’s path to mainstream financial products. The change comes against a different political backdrop than in previous years. Grayscale’s head of research, Zach Pandl, told Cointelegraph in the episode that the Trump administration’s arrival created momentum for regulatory clarity. “President Trump and the Trump administration came into office with a mandate from voters to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry in the US,” Pandl said. “It’s really been a whole-of-government effort. Whether it’s the White House or Congress or the SEC, it’s just responding to that message from voters.” Related: US government shutdown enters day 1: How is the SEC still functioning? He added that bipartisan support has given both businesses and investors confidence that crypto “is very much here to stay, for the long run in the US.” Demand beyond Bitcoin The key question is how much demand actually exists for altcoin ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart also noted in the episode that Solana and XRP stand out because of their existing futures markets, but he cautioned against expecting Bitcoin-level inflows. “They will do decently well as far as flows and AUM go,” Seyffart said, “but the long-term growth story may lie in basket or index products.” Pandl echoed that sentiment, pointing to Grayscale’s latest diversified index fund. “We’re encouraged not only to be bringing these single-asset ETPs to market, but also the first diversified index-based crypto ETP, a kind of one-stop shop solution for crypto exposure in a portfolio,” he said. What comes next? Seyffart said approval could open the floodgates for rapid product expansion, adding: “You’re going to see things like staking Solana ETFs, covered call ETFs, leveraged and inverse products. … It’s going to get crazy.” Whether October brings immediate market inflows or simply sets the stage for growth, analysts agree the regulatory environment has shifted. For the first time, altcoin ETFs appear closer than ever to mainstream US markets.

A Laser Digital spokesperson confirmed Friday that the unit is in pre-consultation talks with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and intends to apply for a license to offer crypto trading services to institutional investors in the country. However, the spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the application date remains “undetermined,” and will depend on the outcome of the discussions with the FSA. If approved, Laser Digital would launch broker-dealer services for traditional financial and crypto-focused companies, including exchanges in Japan. Nomura is part of the Nomura Group, Japan’s largest investment bank and brokerage group. Japanese institutions plan to invest in crypto The move follows a broader push by institutions into the Japanese crypto market. Earlier this week, Daiwa Securities Group, one of Japan’s largest brokerages, introduced a crypto lending service that allows clients to borrow Japanese yen using Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) as collateral. Laser Digital and Daiwa’s push into the Japanese market seems to be a response to growing demand for crypto investments in the region.

The SEC’s silence has left the crypto community uncertain about how the regulator will function amid a federal government shutdown and how its new generic listing standards would affect the timelines of dozens of crypto ETF applications awaiting approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and FOX News reporter Eleanor Terrett noted that the old 19b-4 deadlines for crypto ETF applications may no longer be relevant, as the SEC has asked applicants to withdraw them, leaving the S-1 registration statement as the sole document requiring regulatory approval. Source: Eleanor Terrett However, overshadowing that is another layer of uncertainty surrounding the government shutdown. In August, the SEC posted an “Operation Plan” in the event of a government shutdown, stating it would “not review and approve applications for registration.” This includes new financial products, self-regulatory organization rule changes, and reviewing or accelerating the effectiveness of registration statements. It is unclear whether the SEC’s silence on Canary’s spot Litecoin ETF is solely due to the government shutdown or whether it is also a result of the new generic listing standards, which would render the 19b-4 deadline irrelevant. Canary withdrew its 19b-4 last week, complicating the matter Canary withdrew its 19b-4 application on Sept. 25 at the SEC’s request, which may have been a contributing factor to the SEC not deciding on Thursday. It is unclear what impact the 19b-4s will have on applicants who haven’t withdrawn that document. pic.twitter.com/FmbMfWWaqe — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 2, 2025 Cointelegraph reached out to the SEC and Canary for comment, but didn’t receive an immediate response.

Despite the setbacks, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Monday that the SEC’s new listing standards have bumped the odds of some spot crypto ETF approvals to 100%. The listing standards are expected to streamline the process under Rule 6c-11, significantly reducing approval timelines, which typically take up to 240 days. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the new listing standards will reduce barriers to accessing digital asset products and offer investors more choice.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED United Kingdom officials are weighing whether to retain billions of dollars in gains from seized Bitcoin tied to a massive fraud case, rather than distributing the full, current value to victims, according to the Financial Times. According to a Thursday Financial Times report , the UK High Court may decide to reimburse only the original value of the investments, about 640 million British pounds ($862 million), to victims of the scam . This is despite the seized 61,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) being worth nearly $7.24 billion at the time of writing, resulting in an excess of about $6.4 billion. The Bitcoin was seized in 2018 in north London from scammers who defrauded 128,000 investors in China. Some Treasury officials have privately debated whether the windfall could help offset a budget deficit of up to 30 billion pounds ($40.5 billion). Under existing rules , assets seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act are usually paid into the Home Office or the Treasury Consolidated Fund, with court-ordered compensation when required.

Qian pleaded guilty to acquiring and possessing criminal property, while Ling pleaded guilty to transferring criminal property. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian led a large-scale fraud scheme in China, siphoning assets from over 128,000 victims. These assets were later stored as Bitcoin when she fled China using false documents and entered the United Kingdom. In September 2018, Qian attempted to launder the proceeds by acquiring property.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Digital asset treasury companies will eventually consolidate under a few larger players as the cycle matures and companies try to attract investors, according to Coinbase’s head of investment research, David Duong. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Duong said outside of strategies to boost share prices, “companies may start to pursue mergers and acquisitions, much like the recent Strive and Semler Scientific deal, as we approach the more mature phases of the DAT cycle.” Asset manager turned Bitcoin treasury company Strive announced on Sept. 22 that it was acquiring fellow DAT Semler Scientific in an all-stock transaction. Source: Strive At the same time, Duong said, DATs are also pursuing more crypto-native strategies, such as generating yields through staking or DeFi looping, which involves repeatedly borrowing and repositioning the same asset to amplify returns. “And there’s still a lot more they can do here. I think the future will depend a lot on what happens with regulatory shifts, liquidity and market pressures to get a clearer sense of where this could all go long-term.” On Sept. 15, Standard Chartered predicted that not all DATs will survive in the long term, which may force them to adopt new strategies or fade away. Crypto treasuries are hoping to dominate one token Duong and fellow Coinbase researcher Colin Basco said in a Sept. 10 report that the DAT race has entered a player-vs-player phase, with companies battling to stand out from the competition. Duong said recent share buybacks from crypto treasury firms in the last few weeks are a result of this new stage. Trump Jr.-linked media company Thumzup, which holds Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), announced on Sept. 24 that it was increasing a share buyback from $1 million to $10 million. Solana ( SOL ) treasury company DeFi Development Corp also expanded its share repurchase from $1 million to $100 million. Source: DeFi Development Corp “I believe where this is coming from is that companies are under the impression that only a handful of major players will dominate each token, and they are competing to differentiate themselves through either size or financial engineering,” Duong said. “I also think this strategy likely contributed to the negative price action observed in mid-to-late September, as these entities prioritized using capital to boost stock prices over accumulating crypto.” Some DATs have struggled to maintain share prices, with some losing up to 90% of their value , which has been attributed to market saturation and investor concerns over the sustainability. Share buybacks don’t equal success Duong also said that it’s his experience that share buybacks may not always result in a price bump, particularly when the market perceives the action as a negative signal about the company’s long-term health, because it’s ultimately “very much sentiment-driven.” Related: Crypto treasuries risk 50% downside on PIPE selling pressure “The effectiveness of buybacks hinges on investors’ perceptions of a company’s underlying fundamentals,” he said. “For instance, if a DAT is using buybacks as a defensive maneuver to reduce its float, but market players think the company retains an efficient capital allocation strategy and transparent funding, then its share price may benefit. Conversely, the reverse is true when the right conditions aren’t met.” TON Strategy Company, previously known as Verb Technology Company, announced a stock buyback on Sept. 12 , but investors didn’t react positively, with shares declining 7.5%.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, pointing to its design as more favorable for investors. Speaking with Cointelegraph editor Andrew Fenton at Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley argued that Solana’s quicker unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum. For instance, Ethereum’s withdrawal queue recently reached new highs, while Solana’s typically clears faster. Horsley said that difference matters for issuers who must be able to return assets to investors quickly. “It’s a huge problem,” Horsley said. “The ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to help secure a network in return for rewards paid in the same token. Because the assets are locked, withdrawals can face delays as they fluctuate based on network demand. Horsley noted that Ethereum-based products can work around the issue. For instance, Bitwise’s Ethereum staking exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe uses a credit facility to keep redemptions liquid. Such facilities, however, come at a cost and have “capacity constraints,” he said. Another alternative is liquid staking tokens such as Lido’s stETH, which represent staked assets and allow investors to remain liquid while still earning rewards. Horsley’s comments come after Ethereum’s staking entry queue climbed to 860,369 ETH in early September, the highest level since 2023. The ETH staking queue currently stands at 201,984 ETH, with an average wait time of about three days. The exit queue is far longer, roughly 34 days, with more than 2 million staked tokens awaiting withdrawal, according to onchain data .

Senator Warren argues against granting special tax exemptions for smaller crypto transactions.

She concluded by saying that no special tax exemptions should be granted for digital assets and that all money made from crypto transactions should be taxed under the existing policy framework governing securities and commodities investing.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Oct. 1 at 8:35 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from Summer Mersinger. The future leadership of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), already having faced four commissioner departures in 2025, hangs in the balance after the White House withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination. On Tuesday, Quintenz, a former commissioner and head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, confirmed that the White House had withdrawn his nomination as CFTC chair more than seven months after it was officially announced. The withdrawal came following reports suggesting that Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both donors and supporters of US President Donald Trump, had been pressing the White House to reconsider Quintenz. Even amid delays for consideration in the US Senate and reports of the Winklevosses’ opposition, many advocacy organizations for the crypto and blockchain industry continued to push for Trump to stick with Quintenz to lead the CFTC. Representatives from the Crypto Council for Innovation, Blockchain Association, Decentralization Research Center, DeFi Education Fund, The Digital Chamber, Satoshi Action Fund and Solana Policy Institute said in August that Quintenz was “exceptionally well-suited” to head the agency. “Though we are disappointed [Quintenz] won’t be the next leader there, we are confident the Administration will nominate someone with the expertise and experience to lead the agency into the next generation of innovation-friendly, consumer-focused regulation efforts,” Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone told Cointelegraph. Among the reported prospective nominees to replace Quintenz were Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force; Tyler Williams, a counselor to the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; financial services consultant and former CFTC commissioner Jill Sommers; National Credit Union Administration chair Kyle Hauptman, and Milbank partner Josh Stirling. Cointelegraph reached out to Gemini for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Related: US regulators dismiss SEC-CFTC merger rumors, move to dispel crypto ‘FUD’ The CFTC faces a dearth of leadership, impending departure Since Sept. 3, following the departure of commissioner Kristin Johnson, acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham has stood in as the sole remaining head of the agency. Pham said in May that she planned to move to the private sector after the Senate had confirmed Quintenz, meaning whoever Trump picks as a replacement will likely have significant influence over commodities and crypto policy. “Even as the CFTC faces resource constraints during the government shutdown, the Commission has shown time and again that its relatively small staff is not only efficient but also highly skilled and technical,” Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, also a former CFTC commissioner, told Cointelegraph. “We are confident the agency will continue to rise to the occasion […] as Congress advances critical market structure legislation.” The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), another significant financial regulator, is also short-staffed. The regulator has had at least one empty seat on its panel of five commissioners following the departure of Jaime Lizárraga in January. As of Wednesday, Trump had yet to put forward a name to fill a seat for the Democratic SEC commissioner. The US government shut down at midnight on Tuesday after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a funding bill.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Members of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began shutting down operations on Wednesday under a lapse in government funding, with most staff directed to secure their work and prepare for what could be a days-long pause in operations. According to a Wednesday notice on X, about nine hours after US lawmakers were unable to pass a bill to continue funding the government, the SEC was operating in accordance with a plan set up in August. The plan stated that the agency would have an “extremely limited number of staff” and many of its systems would operate “under modified conditions.” “On the first workday of a lapse in appropriations, non-excepted staff will engage in activities to shut down their respective operations, to secure their workstations and work materials, and to prepare for the rapid restart of operations when funding is renewed,” said the SEC. Related: US government shutdown may signal crypto market bottom: Analysts What exactly can the SEC do for crypto during a shutdown? In addition to limited staff, the agency said it will “not engage in ongoing litigation,” except for emergency cases or those involving a threat to property. This suggested that any enforcement actions against crypto companies could be effectively paused until the shutdown ends. The SEC will also be unable to review any registration applications, “engage in non-emergency rulemaking,” oversee self-regulatory organizations, and provide “non-emergency assistance” to foreign regulatory authorities. Cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications awaiting approval will likely be put on hold under these requirements, but the SEC’s electronic filing system will continue to accept submissions. For example, several Solana ( SOL ) ETFs are currently awaiting approval. Many experts had anticipated the SEC would sign off on the investment vehicles for trading on US exchanges by mid-October, but that timeline could be delayed amid a government shutdown.

Democrats have so far held the line, asking for a reversal in many of the healthcare cuts from a Republican-backed budget bill signed into law in July.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey suggested that stablecoins could reduce the United Kingdom’s reliance on commercial banks, signaling a potential shift in the central bank’s stance toward digital assets. In a Wednesday article in the Financial Times, Bailey said that the current financial system combines money and credit creation through fractional reserve banking, in which banks hold a portion of deposits while lending out the rest. Fractional reserve banking is a system in which banks hold only a fraction of customer deposits in reserve and lend out the rest, thereby creating new money through credit expansion. “Most of the assets backing commercial bank money are not risk-free: they are loans to individuals and to companies,” Bailey wrote in the FT. “The system does not have to be organised like this.“ Bailey said it’s possible to, at least partially, “separate money from credit provision.” In such a system, banks and stablecoins would coexist, while non-banks would carry out a greater portion of the credit provision role. Still, Bailey cautioned that “it is important to consider the implications of such a change thoroughly before going ahead.” Bank of England headquarters. Source: Wikimedia Related: UK Finance pilots tokenized sterling deposits with six major banks Industry pushback on stablecoin limits Bailey’s comments follow criticism of the Bank of England’s stance on stablecoins by UK-based cryptocurrency industry advocacy groups. The organizations criticized a plan by the BoE that would set individual caps for stablecoin holdings. According to industry groups, implementing the limit would be challenging and costly, potentially leaving the UK behind other jurisdictions in the stablecoin field. Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase, claimed that “no other major jurisdiction has deemed it necessary to impose caps.” Still, Bailey’s comments could imply a change of direction. He clarified that his focus is on the mass adoption of stablecoin for payments and settlements. Current stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, he said, do not yet qualify. Related: UK to strengthen ties with US on crypto matters: Report Stablecoins to hold Bank of England accounts In his FT article, Bailey said the bank will publish a consultation paper on the UK’s systemic stablecoin regime in the coming months. This new regime would apply to stablecoins intended for use as money, as he explains, “for everyday payments or for settling tokenised core financial markets.” He went as far as to note that “widely used UK stablecoins should have access to accounts at the [Bank of England] to reinforce their status as money.” This move, Bailey explained, is crucial to creating a regime that ensures the UK can reap the benefits of stablecoins while maintaining financial stability. The remarks follow Bailey’s warning against banks issuing stablecoins in mid-July, saying the BoE should focus on tokenizing deposits instead. Ensuring that stablecoins have accounts at the central bank appears to be an indirect way for the BoE to tokenize its deposits. Stablecoins need to evolve Despite his openness toward stablecoins, Bailey noted that some features would “require scrutiny” and that the banking assets should be risk-free. Furthermore, he suggested that stablecoins require insurance against operational risks, such as hacks, as well as standardized terms of exchange. He said that “it should also be possible to have innovation in the form of money” and consequently “it would therefore be wrong to be against stablecoins.” He instead recognizes their “potential in driving innovation in payment systems.” Magazine: UK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, will AI take your job?

This is a negligence theory,” the motion states.

The service ended up in legal trouble primarily because it was allegedly used to launder billions of dollars in illicit funds, including funds linked to North Korean hackers. Tornado Cash was also accused of facilitating money laundering , with the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) claiming it processed over $7 billion in digital currency since 2019 and 30% of it was allegedly linked to illegal activities.

The arrest was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Division in Washington, D.C. In late August, a US Department of Justice official opposed Storm’s retrial . The case has drawn sharp criticism from the crypto industry. In August, the pro-crypto US lobby group Blockchain Association stated that Storm’s conviction could set a “dangerous” precedent for developers and privacy . The group also pointed out that Storm did not exercise control over the crypto that went through the protocol. “Roman Storm built privacy tech that operated without his custody/control over the funds of Tornado Cash users.

France’s central bank, the Banque de France (BdF), reported a net loss of 7.7 billion euros ($8 billion) in fiscal year 2024, mainly driven by negative net interest income due to high interest payments, according to a press release published in March 2025. This brought France’s government deficit to over 168 billion euros ($176 billion) in 2024, representing 5.8% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), significantly exceeding the European Union’s 3% limit. France’s central bank is now among the bloc’s worst performers, with the shortfall signaling capital outflows from the country.

Exactly the sort of thing the industry was asking for over the last few years.” Pseudonymous crypto trader Marty Party was also in favor of the SEC’s letter, and predicted it would result in “many more crypto custodians,” which they said would be “great news for crypto adoption.” Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, meanwhile, was “encouraged to see the SEC recognizing state-chartered trust companies as qualified digital asset custodians,” and also pointed out her state made a similar move in 2020 , which the Biden-era SEC condemned at the time.

The Trump White House has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life,” Quintenz told Cointelegraph, confirming a Politico report on Tuesday “I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration,” Quintenz added. “I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and head of crypto policy at a16z, was widely backed by the crypto industry, but his nomination faced delays in Congress and reported pushback from crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

Quintenz shared a series of private messages between himself and the Winklevosses on X last month, claiming Trump “might have been misled.” Related: US regulators dismiss SEC-CFTC merger rumors, move to dispel crypto ‘FUD’ “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” Quintenz said at the time. “It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” The messages shared by Quintenz show the Winklevoss twins were unhappy with his response to discussing information about Gemini’s civil case with the CFTC, which the exchange settled for $5 million in January. Some messages show the brothers pushing for “cultural reform” and ending “lawfare” against crypto firms by the CFTC moving forward. In response, Quintenz stated that he would address these issues if and when he was confirmed to lead the agency. The CFTC has been without a full-fledged chair for almost a year now and is being led solely by Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who had said she would leave the agency upon Quintenz’s nomination.

According to a Tuesday Bloomberg report, the European Systemic Risk Board passed a recommendation last week to ban certain stablecoins issued jointly in the EU and other jurisdictions. The policy, while not legally binding, could pressure authorities to restrict the activities of stablecoin issuers like Circle and Paxos, which operate in the region. The reported move by the EU watchdog group came just a few weeks after European Central Bank President (ECB) Christine Lagarde called for policymakers to address crypto regulation, calling out potential gaps in stablecoins issued by non-EU entities.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly developing a plan to allow blockchain-registered versions of stocks to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges — a move that would mark a significant step toward integrating digital asset technology into the traditional financial system. The proposal, still in early stages, would let investors buy and sell stock tokens — digital representations of shares in publicly traded companies — on approved crypto platforms, The Information reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The initiative reflects growing regulatory openness to tokenization, the process of creating blockchain-based tokens that mirror ownership of traditional assets. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently described tokenization as an “innovation” the agency should seek to advance, not restrict. Regulators “should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace,” he said, noting that tokenized assets could improve access to financial markets and reduce costs. Interest in stock tokenization has accelerated in recent months. Platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken have begun offering tokenized stock products. At the same time, Nasdaq has requested SEC approval for a rule change that would allow it to list tokenized securities on its exchange. Crypto exchange Coinbase is also reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities. Source: Nate Geraci Still, the SEC’s apparent willingness to embrace blockchain-based equities has drawn pushback from traditional finance companies. In a July note to the agency’s Crypto Task Force, Citadel Securities cautioned regulators to ensure that tokenization delivers genuine market benefits rather than exploiting regulatory gaps. “Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” Citadel wrote.

It said the alleged manipulation was “effectuated through recommendations, made to investors by unknown persons via social media to purchase” QMMM shares, “which appear to be designed to artificially inflate the price and volume.” QMMM Holdings shares are up over 1,700% in the past month after announcing on Sept. 9 that it would buy and hold Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), joining dozens of companies that have recently made similar moves in the hopes of boosting their shares. The SEC declined to comment. QMMM Holdings did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Crypto strategy unrelated to trading halt Carl Capolingua, senior editor at the market analysis platform Market Index, told Cointelegraph that such SEC trading suspensions are “very rare, generally because of the consequences for company management.” “If the SEC can link those ‘unknown persons’ responsible for promoting buying the company’s stock back to employees, or worse, to management, then the penalties can be severe, including large fines or jail time,” he added. Capolingua said while QMMM’s crypto pivot may have made the business more attractive to some investors, its crypto strategy “isn’t likely to be an item of scrutiny” for the SEC as the alleged “illegal stock promotion is the main issue here.” IG Australia analyst Tony Sycamore told Cointelegraph that if investors want crypto exposure, “these types of Hail Mary plays are not the way to go about it.” QMMM gains over 1,700% before trading pause Shares in QMMM Holdings (QMMM) closed trading on Friday at $119.40, having gained over 1,730% in the past month from around $6.50.

In a Friday update to a bill “relative to a Bitcoin strategic reserve” introduced by Republican state Senator Peter Durant, Massachusetts’ Joint Revenue Committee will hold a hearing to consider the legislation. The bill, which Durant introduced to the Massachusetts Senate in February, was part of a push from Republican lawmakers across several US states in favor of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves. Text of the proposed Bitcoin reserve bill as of Monday. Source: LegiScan It’s unclear what the chances would be for any Republican-led bill to pass in Massachusetts’ legislature. Democrats currently have a supermajority in the state’s House of Representatives and Senate, and control the governorship. All of the state’s representatives in the US House and Senate are also Democrats. Durant’s proposed law would allow “any Bitcoin or other digital asset seized by the commonwealth” to be deposited into a reserve, and have the state treasury use up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund to invest in crypto. While four US states, including Massachusetts, are formally called commonwealths in their constitutions, their legal relationship to the United States as a whole is the same as all states, and the terms are used interchangeably. Cointelegraph reached out to the Massachusetts senator’s office for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. Related: A Bitcoin strategic reserve may be bad for BTC and USD: Crypto exec As of September, only a few US state governments, including New Hampshire and Texas, have passed legislation allowing them to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of a strategic reserve plan. At the federal level, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a government stockpile of BTC and cryptocurrencies, partially through seized assets. Republican lawmakers are attempting to codify this order into law through Congress using the BITCOIN Act. Crypto reserve proposals in other US states are still pending Massachusetts joined a handful of other state governments that are currently considering whether to follow the federal government’s example and pass laws allowing their treasuries to invest in crypto and Bitcoin. In 2025, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming rejected or failed to advance similar bills. However, proposed legislation in Michigan and Ohio could still be signed into law. Companies with exposure to crypto, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy, have been investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation for years. Reports suggested that many others followed their example in 2025 after Trump’s executive order.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Unless Republicans negotiate with Democrats and sign off on a bipartisan funding bill, the US government will shut down at midnight on Tuesday, likely delaying any consideration of a digital asset market structure bill in the Senate. On Monday, the US House of Representatives and Senate leaders are scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump to negotiate terms to avoid a government shutdown. Though in the majority of both chambers of Congress, Republicans need additional support to pass a temporary funding bill to keep the government open, leading to Democrats asking for a reversal in many of the healthcare cuts from a budget bill signed into law in July — i.e., the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” A shutdown would effectively stop US lawmakers from considering or voting on any bills currently moving through Congress, including having Trump sign them into law, and likely any regulatory actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This would mean that consideration of the digital asset market structure bill in the US Senate Banking Committee, already pushed from the end of September to October, could see additional delays. Prediction market chances on the US government shutting down by Oct. 1. Source: Polymarket Though partial or complete government shutdowns over policy disputes have occurred since the Reagan administration in the 1980s, Trump holds the record for being at the helm during the longest one in US history: 35 days in 2018 and 2019, over his plan to build a US-Mexico border wall. Lawmakers’ priorities during a shutdown would likely shift to continuing to fund the government rather than any unrelated bills like crypto market structure. Related: ‘Strong chance’ US will form Strategic Bitcoin Reserve this year: Alex Thorn What to expect from negotiations Trump said last week that “no meeting with [Democratic] Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive” to avoid a potential shutdown, with the White House later issuing a statement suggesting that the president would not be open to any negotiations. However, Trump is set to meet with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Monday. Thune said in a Sunday interview that Republicans had a “simple, seven-week funding resolution” that would temporarily extend funding for the government through November. Jeffries pushed back on the characterization of the measure as a “clean bill” last week, saying that it did nothing to address Democrats’ call to reverse healthcare cuts in the July spending bill. The market structure bill in the Senate, also known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, is expected to build upon the CLARITY Act passed by the House in July, clarifying the roles the CFTC and SEC would have in overseeing digital assets. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s most significant Republican proponents, initially planned to have it pass the banking committee by the end of September. Reports suggested that the committee had pushed consideration to late October, and a government shutdown could further delay this timeline. Should negotiations fail and neither side agree to a funding bill, the US government will shut down at midnight Tuesday.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Oct. 1, 00:30 UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from DNA Fund co-founder Chris Miglino. Predictive Oncology (POAI), a biotechnology company specializing in AI-driven cancer research, has announced a $344.4 million digital asset treasury centered on Aethir’s ATH token, marking the first time a Nasdaq-listed company will hold and actively manage tokens from a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). The capital strategy was developed with guidance from DNA Fund , a Web3 investment and advisory company, and BTIG, which served as the placement agent, Predictive Oncology disclosed Monday. It was structured as two concurrent private placements in public equity (PIPEs), combining cash investment with a crypto PIPE involving in-kind contributions of ATH tokens, DNA Fund said in a separate announcement. The structure allows Predictive Oncology to record tokenized DePIN infrastructure as a balance sheet asset, introducing a hybrid financing model that connects traditional equity markets with decentralized computing networks. The ATH treasury will be tied directly to Aethir’s decentralized GPU infrastructure. Aethir is a decentralized cloud network that provides GPU infrastructure for AI, high-performance computing and gaming applications. The network uses blockchain technology to coordinate and distribute access to physical compute resources, positioning it as a key participant in the DePIN market. The network’s native asset, ATH, is currently trading at under $0.06 with a market capitalization of about $640 million, according to CoinMarketCap. ATH’s 24-hour trading volume has increased by more than 330%, likely due to the Predictive Oncology treasury announcement. Aethir ( ATH ) token price.

As such, “Predictive Oncology saw Aethir as a strong shell […] while also giving DNA Fund a way to participate in building a ‘compute reserve’ that anyone, from institutions to retail, can access,” Miglino said.

In its most recent quarter, Predictive Oncology raised about $586,000 through an at-the-market offering facility to help fund operations. In March, the company sold its Skyline Medical division, which manufactured an automated fluid waste management device used in medical centers, as part of a broader strategy to cut expenses and refocus on AI-driven drug discovery. Predictive Oncology’s new strategy positions it among a growing group of small-cap and microcap firms pivoting toward digital asset treasury models. In July, the former biotech company 180 Life Sciences rebranded as ETHZilla and announced plans to accumulate Ether ( ETH ) as a treasury asset. Other publicly traded companies, including Mill City Ventures (MCVT), Nature’s Miracle (NMHI), Upexi (UPXI), Helius Medical Technologies (HSDT) and AVAX One , formerly AgriFORCE Growing Systems, have made similar moves to integrate crypto assets into their balance sheets.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Swift interbank communication network is working with Ethereum ecosystem developer Consensys to develop a blockchain settlement system. According to a Monday announcement , the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is developing a blockchain in collaboration with over 30 financial institutions and Consensys. The initial focus is on developing infrastructure for “real-time 24/7 cross-border payments .” One of the objectives of the new blockchain will be interoperability with “existing and emerging networks,” while also maintaining compliance. Consensys is tasked with developing the conceptual prototype in the first phase and defining the future work phases. “The ledger will extend Swift’s financial communication role into a digital environment,” the announcement said. Swift added that the platform will support the exchange of tokenized assets, though the types of tokens will ultimately be determined by central and commercial banks. Related: SWIFT declares second sandbox connector tests a success for CBDC and more A new backbone for traditional finance Blockchain, once described as a solution in search of a problem, is now being adopted rapidly by the traditional finance industry. Per the announcement, the vision for Swift’s new infrastructure is “a secure, real-time log of transactions between financial institutions.” This would be important considering that Swift underpins most international payments in the modern financial ecosystem. According to the organization’s website , over 11,500 institutions in over 200 countries rely on the company’s infrastructure to process their transactions. Swift does not directly move any money; instead, it provides an interbank communication network. It is meant to reduce errors and fraud risk. It is so pervasive that sanctions or exclusion from Swift can effectively cut a country or bank off from the global financial system. “Because there are very few alternatives to SWIFT, financial sanctions that limit access to this network have become particularly costly for sanctioned entities,” according to a US Federal Reserve Bank of New York report .

In March 2024, Swift publicly recognized the value of tokenization and the shared ledger model. The organization sees a continuing role for its messaging layer within a blockchain-based financial system: “Shared ledgers are not well-suited to carrying and storing high volumes of data due to the way data is synchronised across parties and the computing power required. This is where a messaging layer fits in.” In November 2024, Swift provided its global financial messaging network to integrate tokenized fund processes with existing fiat payment systems.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The crypto industry could be set for a flood of new crypto exchange-traded funds in October, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission set to make their final decisions on 16 crypto ETFs next month. The ETFs are connected to a variety of major altcoins , including Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), which have final deadlines scattered throughout October. Up for approval first is Canary’s Litecoin ETF, with a deadline of Oct. 2, followed by asset manager Grayscale’s Solana and Litecoin trust conversion on Oct. 10 and ending with WisdomTree’s XRP fund on Oct. 24, according to a list of upcoming approvals created by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. The decision could happen anytime before the final deadline.

The CFTC still doesn’t have a permanent chair, but there are reportedly several pro-crypto contenders who are under consideration to lead the agency. Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Almost a year into the second term of US President Donald Trump, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) still doesn’t have a permanent head. Former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz was Trump’s top choice for the role. A confirmation vote was expected by the end of July but was stalled at the request of the White House. Reportedly, the Winklevoss brothers didn’t want Quintenz as chair because he wouldn’t sufficiently protect the cryptocurrency industry. So, who will it be? In recent weeks, several different names have appeared as possible candidates, including former commissioners and policy experts. The White House has not confirmed its choice, but some names have been floated by insiders. The crypto industry is playing close attention — especially since the market infrastructure bill making its way through Congress would give the CFTC significant regulatory oversight. Michael Selig Source: PLI In a Sept. 19 report citing White House insiders, Bloomberg reported that Michael Selig was under consideration to head the CFTC. Current role: Selig is chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force. Past experience: Selig was a partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where he worked in its crypto and digital assets practice. He was also counsel at Perkins Coie and an associate at Reed Smith. Thoughts on crypto: Immediately following Trump’s election, Selig said that the next head of the SEC must take a “do no harm” approach to crypto. He also called for an end to “regulation by enforcement” by the SEC. Tyler Williams Source: TRM Labs White House sources speaking to Bloomberg also tipped Tyler Williams as a candidate under consideration to lead the CFTC. Current role: Williams is currently a counselor to the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, advising on digital assets and blockchain technology policy. Past experience: Williams served as Galaxy Digital’s global head of policy, prior to which he operated his own financial services consulting firm in Washington, D.C. He was also a senior advisor at FS Vector and a senior policy advisor for Republican Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s campaign. Thoughts on crypto: Williams was one of the lead authors of the White House’s crypto report . In an interview with TRM Labs, Williams stressed the need to give certainty to the crypto industry and provide a “durable framework.” Jill Sommers Source: Medium Crypto in America journalist Eleanor Terrett reported on Sept. 25 that former CFTC commissioner Jill Sommers was under consideration to lead the agency. Current role: According to LinkedIn, Sommers is currently a financial services consultant in the Washington, D.C. area. Past experience: From 2007 to 2013, Sommers served as a commissioner at the CFTC at the nomination of President Barack Obama. At the CFTC, she was chairman of the Global Markets Advisory Committee and was the commission designee to the Financial Literacy and Education Commission. After leaving the CFTC, she became chair of the derivatives practice group at Potomak Global Partners and joined the FTX.US board of directors in 2022. Thoughts on crypto: Sommers has not said much publicly on crypto. When she joined FTX.US, she emphasized working closely with regulators to better form regulations for crypto derivatives. Kyle Hauptman Source: NCUA Terrett also tipped that Kyle Hauptman is on the White House’s short list for CFTC chair. Current role: Hauptman is currently the chairman of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), nominated by Trump. The NCUA insures credit unions and provides deposit insurance. Past experience: Prior to serving at the NCUA, Hauptman was a counselor on economic and financial policy to Senator Tom Cotton and was staff director for the Senate Banking Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic Policy. He was also an advisory committee member at the SEC. Thoughts on crypto: Hauptman hasn’t made public comments regarding crypto specifically. However, he has prioritized avoiding stifling regulation and adopting new technology at the NCUA, suggesting he is at least open to novel concepts like crypto and blockchain. Josh Stirling Source: Chambers and Partners On Sept. 24, Semafor reported that lawyer Josh Stirling was under consideration to run the CFTC, citing sources familiar with the matter. Current role: Currently, Stirling is a partner at Milbank and a member of its white collar and investigations and derivatives/alternative financial products practices. He also represents the prediction market Kalshi. Past experience: Stirling previously served as co-chair of the derivatives subcommittee of corporation, finance and law community at the Bar Association of the District of Columbia. He was also a member of the capital markets strategic litigation advisory committee at the US Chamber of Commerce. Thoughts on crypto: While at the CFTC, Stirling gave a statement on “Supporting Innovation in Digital Asset Products.” He has noted customer protection concerns regarding digital assets and said , “The CFTC itself feel that they have a valuable and constructive role, maybe even a primary role in regulating the digital assets, marketplace, and ecosystem.” Combining the SEC and CFTC? One unorthodox proposal has been to combine the CFTC and SEC. According to crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan, some high-level sources are considering consolidating the two agencies, essentially making Paul Atkins, the current SEC chief, head of the CFTC. Brogan said that the only problems are how it would work or whether it’s legal. The Trump administration has appointed one person to head up multiple agencies, although these aren’t quite the same as the CFTC. Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor and administrative law researcher at Stanford Law School, said, “It is not clear whether he could be both a confirmed member of the Securities Exchange Commission and a confirmed member at the CFTC because there is this [SEC statute] that says no SEC Commissioner can engage in other employment.” There are also ethical issues. Professor Nick Bednar at the University of Minnesota Law School said, “As a policy matter, the Trump administration’s efforts to consolidate power over multiple agencies in a handful of officials is worrying.” After all, a person only has so much time in a day, and being spread across multiple agencies “makes it harder to ensure proper management within a given agency. The centralization of control comes with a significant cost to administrative capacity and good governance.” Regardless of who the White House eventually nominates, they also need to pass the sometimes lengthy nomination process in the Senate.

In late August, DBS also decided to expand its digital asset offerings with the launch of tokenized structured notes on the Ethereum blockchain. The bank is no stranger to stablecoins, being responsible for managing the US dollar reserve of the Global Dollar (USDG). In late 2024, DBS also introduced a new suite of blockchain-powered services for its institutional clients and announced the offering of over-the-counter crypto options . The bank also launched a solution last year that uses blockchain technology to streamline the disbursement of government grants .

When the rules, strict as they were, came into force, a Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) official warned that the new local stablecoin regulatory framework had increased the risk of fraud . The statement was largely motivated by the speculative frenzy around companies that announced their interest in obtaining stablecoin licenses. Reports that HSBC and ICBC considered applying for stablecoin licenses were followed by suggestions that the firms backed away under pressure from Chinese authorities. In early August, Chinese authorities instructed local firms to cease publishing research or holding seminars related to stablecoins . This was followed by a since-removed report from major local financial news outlet Caixin that mainland Chinese firms operating in Hong Kong may be forced to withdraw from cryptocurrency-related activities.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto prices will likely be spurred by crypto market structure legislation, stablecoins and a flood of exchange-traded products (ETP) in the fourth quarter, analysts told Cointelegraph, after assets tied to digital treasuries dominated over the last quarter. In a report released on Thursday, crypto asset manager Grayscale's research team said that crypto market structure legislation in the US, the CLARITY Act , represents “comprehensive financial services legislation,” and could be “a catalyst for deeper integration with the traditional financial services industry.” Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of a generic listing standard for commodity-based ETPs could also spark inflows because it increases the “number of crypto assets accessible to US investors.” The researchers also said “crypto assets should be expected to benefit from Fed rate cuts,” with the Federal Reserve slashing rates for the first time since last year on Sept. 17, with more possibly on the way. Although JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cast doubt on more rate cuts, and said on Monday that he thinks the Fed will have a hard time cutting the interest rate unless inflation drops. Source: Grayscale Stablecoin chains could emerge as winners this quarter Speaking to Cointelegraph, Edward Carroll, head of markets at crypto and blockchain investment firm MHC Digital Group, said he expects stablecoin growth to be a key driver of returns in Q4. US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July. It’s aimed at establishing clear rules for payment stablecoins, but is still awaiting final regulations before implementation. “This should be positive medium- to long-term for any chain being used for stables, Ethereum, SOL, Tron, BNB, Eth layer 2s, but more fundamentally to the companies building and providing the products to market,” Carroll said. At the same time, he predicts institutional applications of tokenization will start to gain traction, as larger players start to pursue more tokenized money market funds, bank deposits, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin and altcoins could have a bumper quarter, too Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Australian crypto broker Swyftx, told Cointelegraph that more money is flowing into crypto through funds and automated contributions, and a Bitcoin ( BTC ) rally toward the end of the year will fuel an altcoin surge in Q4. A report from financial services company River released earlier this month found that ETFs are gobbling up, on average, 1,755 Bitcoin per day in 2025. “Unless the market is kneecapped by something unexpected, Bitcoin will likely hit new highs before the end of the year, and that will fuel altcoins,” Hundal said. “It’s been a rotational market for all of 2025, with alt coins performing well after an initial Bitcoin rally. I don’t see any reason for that pattern to change now. The top performers during rotations have been memecoins and DeFi applications like Pump.fun, Hyperliquid and Aster.” Last quarter, Hundal said the big theme was US-listed companies converting to digital asset treasuries, with Ether ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ) and Hype emerging as the top performers in the last few months. Related: Crypto treasury share buybacks could signal a ‘credibility race’ is on DeFi revenue-generating projects could also be a winner Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer of Apollo Crypto, told Cointelegraph he expects Q4 to include ETF approvals in the US, including for staked assets, and the CLARITY Act to pass. “On a sector basis, we believe revenue-generating projects in DeFi will continue to perform very well. Stablecoins and RWA will very likely continue to be major themes overall.” However, he also said “rate cut expectations in the US might disappoint as the economy and labor market seemingly are doing better than the Fed feared when it lowered rates.” Andersson said that in the third quarter, Hyperliquid and Pump buybacks made big waves in crypto markets, along with the “proliferation of digital asset treasuries.” Magazine: How do the world’s major religions view Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? # Bitcoin # Cryptocurrencies # Altcoins # United States # Stablecoin # Regulation Add reaction","Stephen Katte Sep 26, 2025 Crypto bill, stablecoins, new ETPs to drive Q4 crypto returns: Analysts Favorable policy shifts, growing ETP access, and stablecoin momentum could be the key themes for the crypto market coming into Q4, analysts told Cointelegraph.",CoinTelegraph,2025-09-26 03:50:07+00:00,2025-12-07 12:51:49.235765,2025-12-07T19:18:21.371303

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Asset manager Bitwise has filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that holds and tracks the token tied to the crypto perpetual futures protocol and blockchain Hyperliquid. The company is bidding to launch the Bitwise Hyperliquid ETF, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. It would directly hold Hyperliquid (HYPE), a token that gives discounts on its decentralized exchange ( DEX ) and is used to pay fees on its blockchain. The filing doesn’t yet identify the exchange on which the product would trade, the ticker under which it would trade, or the fees Bitwise will charge. Bitwise’s filing comes as competition between perpetual futures DEXs has been heating up after Aster launched a token earlier this month that has seen its trading volume and open interest surge past Hyperliquid, which has long held the top spot for onchain futures trading. Hyperliquid ETF to offer in-kind redemptions Bitwise’s filing said its HYPE ETF will directly hold the token and “seek to provide exposure to the value of Hyperliquid held by the Trust,” similar to the hugely popular Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) ETFs launched last year. The product will also offer in-kind creation and redemptions, allowing for shares in the fund to be exchanged for HYPE tokens instead of cash. Source: James Seyffart The Securities and Exchange Commission allowed in-kind creation and redemption for crypto products in July, which it billed as “less costly and more efficient.” Filing is the first step before launch Bitwise filing was a Form S-1 to register its ETF with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, the so-called “33 Act,” which allows its product to directly hold the crypto token. The ETF will also need a Form 19b-4 to kickstart the approval process with the agency, which could take up to 240 days before it’s approved. Related: Machi Big Brother exits $25M HYPE bet at $4M loss as rivals eat Hyperliquid market share Earlier this month, the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto ETFs to scrap the need to assess each product and speed up approvals, allowing shorter approval timelines if the underlying asset had been traded for six months on a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchange. However, Bitwise noted in its filing that “there are currently no Hyperliquid futures contracts registered with the CFTC.” Aster open interest surges, triples Hyperliquid volume Aster, a perpetual futures DEX native to the BNB Chain, has seen a recent surge in trading volume and open interest far above many of its rivals. The exchange was a key driver of perpetual trading volumes on DEXs, hitting an all-time high of $70 billion on Thursday, with its volume over the last 24 hours surpassing $35.8 billion, more than tripling Hyperliquid’s $10 billion volume over the same period, per DefiLlama. CoinGlass shows the open interest on the Aster (ASTER) token, outstanding contracts yet to be settled, hit $1.15 billion on Thursday, up from under $143 million just days earlier on Saturday, Sept. 20. Meanwhile, open interest on the HYPE token is down 1.85% over the past day to $2.2 billion, with the token’s price having fallen 3.5% over that time to $42.5, per CoinGlass.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Asset management giant BlackRock filed to register a Delaware trust company for its proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF on Thursday, signaling a push to broaden its Bitcoin offerings. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said BlackRock’s proposed product would sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. The regular distributions would, however, trade away potential upside from investing in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which mirrors Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price movements. “This is a covered call Bitcoin strategy in order to give BTC some yield. This will be a ’33 Act spot product, sequel to the $87b $IBIT.” Registering a trust filing in Delaware typically indicates that an ETF issuer will imminently file an S-1 registration statement or 19b-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to officially kick off the process.

Bitcoin yield products slowly coming to market One of the earliest reasons why many TradFi investment companies overlooked Bitcoin is that it isn’t a native yield-generating asset. However, solutions have popped up, such as one of Strategy’s convertible preferred stock offerings, STRK, which leverages its 639,835 Bitcoin to offer investors stable income.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved new listing standards for commodity-based trust shares last week, a policy shift that could shorten the path to launching spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but questions remain for some investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the policy change, announced by the SEC on Sept. 17 , would be a positive move toward a “wave of spot crypto ETP launches.” Eric Balchunas, another senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, suggested that the SEC had just cleared the regulatory tape for crypto ETFs “so long as they have futures on Coinbase,” hinting at the different regulations that applicants will face depending on the investment vehicle they plan to offer. Source: Jake Chervinsky “For a new futures or spot ETF in an already ‘legitimized’ category (BTC, ETH), these recent rule changes have little to no bearing on time to approval,” Seoyoung Kim, an associate professor of finance at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “However, for a futures or spot ETF for digital assets that haven’t already been individually vetted, these rule changes could cut down the time to approval from years to months. Of course, the would-be ETF must still comply with pre-existing standards for ETF formation, listing, and trading.” Federico Brokate, head of US Business at ETF issuer 21Shares, said “in-scope assets” in the listing standards would have “far more predictability for issuers and investors,” resulting in significantly shorter approval times. “No longer are both the S-1 and 19b-4 [applications] required for in-scope or eligible assets,” said Brokate. “Now, if a product meets the generic standards such as qualifying through existing futures or comparable structures, an exchange can list it directly.” Related: SEC approves generic listing standards for faster crypto ETF approvals Are there any risks to ETF issuers or retail investors? The SEC has been cutting back on enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies and generally adopting policies favoring the industry, which some argue could come at the cost of investor protection. Caroline Crenshaw, the sole Democratic commissioner at the SEC, said after the announced listing standards that the policy change bypassed requirements for reviewing investor protection. She added that the crypto ETFs likely to arise from the policy were “new and arguably unproven products.” “Our mission, after all, is to protect investors — not to fast-track untested investment products for listing and trading on exchange,” said Crenshaw. Kim argued that “all pre-existing diligence requirements are still in place,” adding that the rule changes “can be better viewed as clarifications.“ She said: The longstanding extensive requirements from the ’33 and ’40 acts are still in place and have not been lessened by the recent decisions of the SEC.” Greg Benhaim, executive vice president of product at digital asset manager 3iQ, said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph that the generic listing standards could assist average investors in distinguishing which coins to buy. “For example, an AVAX ETF and an ADA ETF are very different but the investor may not appreciate this fully,” Benhaim said. “Over the long term, this will pave the way for the industry to identify which assets have significant retail appeal in ETF format and which don’t.” In the week since the change in listing standards, asset manager Hashdex has expanded its crypto ETF to include XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and Stellar ( XLM ). However, Balchunas and others have speculated that there could be many more soon, pointing to 22 coins with futures on Coinbase that were “eligible for spot ETF-ization.” Magazine: XRP ETF pump ‘disappointment,’ Bitcoin to see out 2025 at $173K: Trade Secrets # SEC # Policies # Regulation # Ethereum ETF # Bitcoin ETF # ETF Add reaction","Turner Wright Sep 25, 2025 What a shortcut for ETF approvals could mean for crypto Experts weighed in on how a recent policy change at the US Securities and Exchange Commission could affect retail crypto investors.",CoinTelegraph,2025-09-25 21:45:00+00:00,2025-12-07 12:52:10.739022,2025-12-07T19:18:21.371303

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A group of major European banks has joined forces to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin in compliance with Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Dutch lender ING and Italy’s UniCredit are among nine banks participating in the development of a euro-denominated stablecoin , according to a joint statement published by ING on Thursday. Built in compliance with Europe’s MiCA regulation , the stablecoin is expected to be issued in the second half of 2026, with a mission of becoming a trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem. The announcement noted that the initiative aligns with Europe’s plans to provide a local alternative to the US-dominated stablecoin market and to contribute to the EU’s strategic autonomy in payments. Banks from eight EU member states initially involved Alongside ING and UniCredit, the European stablecoin initiative also includes Spain’s CaixaBank, Denmark’s Danske Bank, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International, Belgium’s KBC, Sweden’s SEB, Germany’s DekaBank and another Italian lender, Banca Sella. The founding members have also established a new company headquartered in the Netherlands, ING’s home country, to oversee the development and management of the stablecoin. An excerpt from the stablecoin project announcement by ING. Source: ING The banking consortium said in the joint announcement that it remains open to other banks joining the stablecoin project. 24/7 access to cross-border payments According to the statement by ING, the projected euro stablecoin is expected to provide “near-instant, low-cost payments and settlements,” enabling 24/7 access to cross-border payments. The stablecoin is also set to offer programmable payments and improvements to supply chain management and digital asset settlements, which can vary from securities to cryptocurrencies.

Digital euro delayed to 2029 The announcement of a joint stablecoin project by leading European banks came shortly after European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone estimated that the EU’s digital euro could become a reality in 2029 . Cipollone, who also serves as deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, noted that the European Parliament is widely expected to outline a general framework for the EU’s proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) by May 2026.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Wall Street could soon be getting a new exchange-traded fund that bundles up crypto treasury companies, alongside four other funds from crypto trading and market-making firm GSR. The company is looking to launch the GSR Digital Asset Treasury Companies ETF, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, which would invest in public companies such as the Bitcoin ( BTC ) buying Strategy or the Ether ( ETH ) holding BitMine Immersion Technologies. The filing, GSR’s first-ever foray into ETFs, also lists four other funds involving ETH and crypto staking , with one that looks to bundle and track the price of Bitcoin, Ether and Solana ( SOL ). Crypto treasury companies buy and hold crypto for the long term, which has become a popular move due to attracting significant funding. Some have bet on riskier altcoins to get investor attention, alarming some analysts who have warned of an oversaturated market. Crypto treasury ETF agnostic on holdings GSR said in its filing that its crypto treasury ETF would buy shares in public companies that own crypto, and seemingly doesn’t limit the fund to companies holding major tokens like Bitcoin or Ether. “The Fund, under normal market conditions, will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies that hold digital assets in their corporate treasury,” the filing reads. Source: Eric Balchunas It defined its possible investments as “any company that generally maintains a significant portion of its assets in one or more digital assets,” and specified that the ETF doesn’t have minimum market capitalization requirements for the companies it’d invest in. The ETF initially looks to hold “10–15 positions comprised of 5 to 10 issuers,” and some examples of treasury companies could include Sui ( SUI ) buying SUI Group Holdings and the BNB ( BNB ) holding firm CEA Industries . GSR looks to launch three staking ETFs The filing also details the GSR Ethereum Staking Opportunity ETF, the GSR Crypto StakingMax ETF and the GSR Ethereum YieldEdge ETF, which all seek to involve staking rewards. The Ethereum Staking and YieldEdge ETFs will both use an offshore wholly-owned subsidiary to buy and stake ETH on behalf of the fund, as they were filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the so-called “40 Act,” which has limitations on what the ETF can hold. GSR’s Ethereum Staking fund will also invest in Ether staking ETFs, mostly based outside the US, while the YieldEdge ETF will use an “actively managed derivatives strategy designed to enhance yield.” It’s StakingMax ETF, also filed under the 40 Act and using an offshore subsidiary, will aim to invest in cryptocurrencies and securities “with a particular emphasis on proof-of-stake (“PoS”) cryptocurrencies and staking strategies.” Bitcoin, Ether, Solana bundle ETF could hold directly GSR’s fifth ETF in the filing is the GSR Crypto Core3 ETF, which will look to track Bitcoin, Ether and Solana and could directly hold the tokens. The Core3 ETF was filed under the Securities Act of 1933, the same as the hugely popular spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products that launched last year. GSR said the ETF aims to give “balanced exposure to three of the most established digital assets” and would “maintain allocations of approximately one-third of its net assets” each to Bitcoin, Ether and Solana. GSR’s filing comes as other asset managers have launched similar ETFs, including some with staking and others that track a group of crypto tokens, as Wall Street looks to gain exposure to the market.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto treasury companies are starting to see share price gains off the back of stock buyback programs, which analysts say could be a sign that the companies are now battling for credibility. Trump Jr.-linked media company Thumzup, which holds Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), said on Wednesday it was increasing a share buyback from $1 million to $10 million, which sent its stock (TZUP) up 7% for the session and another 0.82% after hours to trade $4.91. At the same time, Solana treasury company DeFi Development Corp (DFDV) expanded its share repurchase from $1 million to $100 million, which saw its stock registered gains of over 5%, before settling at a more than 2% gain and another 1% after hours to trade at $15.50. DeFi Development Corp experienced an 8% rise after expanding its share repurchase from $1 million to $100 million. Source: Google Finance The gains come after Coinbase's head of research, David Duong, and researcher Colin Basco predicted in a Sept. 10 report that crypto-buying public companies are entering a “player vs player” era to compete harder for investor money. Treasury race becoming about credibility Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer of Australian crypto investment manager Merkle Tree Capital, said the stock buybacks are a sign the crypto treasury race is starting to become a “credibility race.” “It’s no longer enough to say ‘we hold Bitcoin.’ Investors want professional capital allocation — buybacks, dividends, clear treasury strategies,” he said. “The fusion of corporate finance tools with the digital-asset narrative is powerful. It signals these companies want to be judged not just on Bitcoin exposure, but on shareholder returns.” Buybacks also a sign of confidence Not all crypto treasury companies with buyback promises have benefited, though. TON Strategy Company, previously known as Verb Technology Company, made a similar move on Sept. 12 , but its stock (TONX) didn’t react positively and declined 7.5%. McMillin said share buybacks represent a “classic signal of confidence,” when a company thinks its stock is undervalued, which matters for listed crypto-treasury companies because “their valuations often swing at a premium or discount to their Bitcoin holdings (mNAV).” “A buyback can tighten that gap by reducing float and showing discipline — which investors reward. The price can also move as traders look to front-run a decent volume of demand. Buying more Bitcoin increases exposure to volatility,” he said. “A buyback, on the other hand, boosts shareholder value directly, while still leaving the crypto treasury story intact. It also appeals to a broader investor base — some want the Bitcoin narrative, others want capital discipline. A well-timed buyback balances both.” Crypto treasury race about dollar vs Bitcoin Meanwhile, Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of the blockchain-based Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that when a company uses cash reserves to buy back shares, there are fewer available for the general public, which leads to scarcity and upward pressure on the price. Related: Ramaswamy-backed Strive buys Semler Scientific in Bitcoin treasury merger “The crypto treasury companies are competing to see which can create the most enticing crypto treasury structure, but what we are seeing is hyperbitcoinization, which is a form of de-dollarization—Bitcoin versus the dollar,” he said.

Stadelmann said he doesn’t think “The phenomenon of crypto asset treasuries” will slow anytime soon, though, because an “increasing number of companies will allocate part of their treasuries into Bitcoin and other crypto assets, including Fortune 500 companies.” “A big question for investors is which companies are most likely to hold onto their Bitcoin through thick and thin, rather than sell amid bear markets or panics.” Magazine: How do the world’s major religions view Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? # Bitcoin # Blockchain # Cryptocurrencies # Altcoins # Business # Adoption # Stocks Add reaction","Stephen Katte Sep 25, 2025 Crypto treasury share buybacks could signal a ‘credibility race’ is on Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that treasury companies are competing to see who can create the most enticing structure.",CoinTelegraph,2025-09-25 04:05:49+00:00,2025-12-07 12:53:18.561583,2025-12-07T19:18:29.358302

The hearing will be led by the Finance Committee’s chair, Mike Crapo, on Wednesday, with Coinbase vice president of tax Lawrence Zlatkin and Coin Center policy director Jason Somensatto to testify, according to the notice released on Wednesday. Source: Eleanor Terrett It falls in line with the White House Digital Asset Working Group’s crypto recommendations in July, which called on lawmakers to recognize crypto as a new asset class and tailor existing tax rules for securities and commodities to digital assets. If no legislation is enacted, it calls on the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service to issue guidance clarifying how stablecoin payments are taxed and how small amounts of crypto earned from airdrops, mining, and staking should be treated. The IRS currently treats crypto and non-fungible tokens as property, not currency, meaning any transaction involving these digital assets can trigger a capital gains tax event if sold or transferred at a profit. Crypto regulation has advanced significantly since Trump returned to office in January, as part of an attempt to boost innovation, retain talent, and make up for slow progress seen under the Biden administration, when tax rules were one of many issues confusing industry players.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Executives from a few cryptocurrency companies will speak on panels to discuss “regulatory harmonization efforts” between two US financial regulators next week. In a Wednesday notice, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it would host a roundtable event with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Monday as part of efforts to coordinate on financial regulation, including cryptocurrencies. Representatives from cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Crypto.com, as well as prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, will speak on panels. Though focused on bridging regulation between the two agencies, the roundtable event will be held amid a dearth of leadership at the CFTC. This year, every commissioner at the financial regulator has resigned or departed, with the exception of acting Chair Caroline Pham. Former CFTC Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo and former commissioner Jill Sommers will be moderating panel discussions on Monday. The roundtable discussions will come as members of Congress consider legislation to create a digital asset market structure in the US, which would likely establish clear roles for the SEC and CFTC in regulating cryptocurrencies. Though the US House of Representatives passed its version of market structure in July through the CLARITY Act, the Senate has yet to vote on a bill. Related: CFTC initiative to allow stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets Cointelegraph reached out to Giancarlo for comment on the roundtable but had not received a response at the time of publication. Shaking up crypto policies in both agencies Since US President Donald Trump took office in January, resulting in the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam stepping down, the two financial regulators have moved forward with policies benefiting the cryptocurrency industry. On the SEC side, the agency dropped several investigations and enforcement actions — some of which had been in court for years — against crypto companies, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs and Kraken. Last week, the regulator signed off on generic listing standards that would likely result in faster approvals for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the CFTC, it’s been a similar story. Though four of its panel of five commissioners have departed in 2025, the agency appointed several crypto company executives to its Global Markets Advisory Committee in September, and has been exploring allowing tokenized assets, including stablecoins, as collateral in derivatives markets.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Former US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) member and US President Donald Trump’s pick to chair the agency, Brian Quintenz, may not face a vote in the Senate after reports suggested Trump was considering other candidates for the job. According to a Wednesday Semafor report, the Trump administration was vetting Josh Sterling, a former director at the CFTC’s market participants division, to chair the agency as Quintenz’s nomination reportedly stalled. Sterling, who worked at the CFTC from 2019 to 2021, was appointed to his position during the first Trump administration and did not face a Senate vote. He is a partner at Milbank, an international law firm. Other candidates to lead the financial regulator reportedly included Mike Selig , who serves as chief counsel at the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto task force and is an adviser to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Tyler Williams, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the former global head of policy at Galaxy Digital, was also reportedly in the running. Quintenz, whom Trump nominated in February to head the CFTC, faced lawmakers in a June hearing at the Senate Agriculture Committee and had been expected to head for a vote at the end of July before the chamber went on recess. However, the White House requested that the committee delay consideration of Quintenz without explanation. Related: CFTC initiative to allow stablecoins as collateral in derivatives markets Since Sept. 3, following the departure of CFTC commissioner Kristin Johnson, the agency’s leadership has been staffed solely by acting chair Caroline Pham. According to Sterling, who notably penned a Bloomberg Law article in June with his Milbank colleague, Amanda Olear, the exodus of commissioners at one of the most significant US financial regulators could put markets at risk: “Leaving a key regulator undermanned risks letting financial markets critical to the US economy fall into neglect. Those markets are crucial to routine commerce, and they have proven time and again [...] to be an important shock absorber for financial risk. It makes absolutely no sense to leave their oversight in doubt.” In a Sept. 12 letter to CFTC and Treasury officials, Sterling also criticized the agency under Pham for “abuse, mismanagement, and waste” in defense of a Milbank client. Are the Winklevosses influencing Trump’s CFTC pick? Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, supported Trump during his 2024 campaign by contributing $2 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ). They have continued to pledge financial support for the president’s crypto agenda, donating $21 million worth of BTC to a pro-Trump political action committee in August. Whether due to their financial support or public statements supporting the president, the Winklevosses appear to have at least some influence over crypto policy coming from the White House. The Gemini co-founders attended a signing ceremony in July for the president’s stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, and were reportedly behind Trump’s push to delay Quintenz’s Senate vote. On Sept. 10, Quintenz provided some evidence to support reports that the Winklevosses were pressing Trump for another CFTC candidate. He released text messages between himself and the two brothers over social media, suggesting that Gemini was looking for certain assurances regarding CFTC enforcement actions should the Senate confirm Quintenz. Despite a letter to Trump from several cryptocurrency and blockchain associations advocating for Quintenz’s confirmation , his potential role heading the CFTC was uncertain. As of Wednesday, the Senate Agriculture Committee calendar showed no hearing to consider Quintenz’s nomination as CFTC chair.

Saylor added that “companies that are capitalizing on Bitcoin are buying even more than the natural supply being created by the miners,” which is “putting upward pressure on the price.” Strategy chair Michael Saylor said Bitcoin demand from ETFs and companies is surpassing daily miner supply, which could drive a year-end rally. Source: CNBC On average, miners generate roughly 900 Bitcoin per day, according to Bitbo. A report from financial services company River released earlier this month found that businesses are gobbling up 1,755 Bitcoin per day in 2025, while ETFs are snapping up an additional 1,430 per day on average in 2025. Buy pressure will push up price toward year-end Bitcoin has been drifting between $111,369 and $113,301 over the last 24 hours, while its seven-day range has been moving between $111,658 and $117,851, according to CoinGecko. Traders were also liquidated out of nearly $2 billion in one of the year’s largest market flush-outs on Monday, which analysts blamed on technical factors rather than weakening market fundamentals. “I think that as we work through the resistance of late and some macro headwinds, we’ll actually see Bitcoin start to move up smartly again toward the end of the year,” Saylor added. Bitcoin buys strengthen public companies Saylor said that Bitcoin-buying companies can be boiled down to two categories, the first being operating companies that would otherwise be returning their capital via dividends and buybacks, which choose Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Bitbo is tracking at least 145 companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, including Strategy , which holds 638,985 BTC. “That actually improves their capital structure. It strengthens those companies. There’s a lot of those,” Saylor said.

The world’s going to run on digital gold-backed credit for the next 300 years. So treasury companies are holding digital capital and creating digital credit instruments,” he said. “And there’s of course, a huge demand for equity and credit instruments and traditional capital markets, Bitcoin is emerging as the ideal form of digital capital to back those instruments.” Magazine: Hayes tips ‘up only’ for crypto, ETH staking exit queue concerns: Hodler’s Digest, Sept. 14 – 20 # Bitcoin # Cryptocurrencies # Business # Data # Michael Saylor Add reaction","Stephen Katte Sep 24, 2025 Bitcoin to ‘move up smartly again’ toward end of 2025: Saylor Strategy chair Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will gain after “macro headwinds” subside as treasury companies and ETFs put upward pressure on the cryptocurrency.",CoinTelegraph,2025-09-24 06:08:24+00:00,2025-12-07 12:54:07.858177,2025-12-07T19:18:29.358302

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japan’s recent policy shifts have helped the country more than double its crypto adoption over the past year, according to crypto analytics company Chainalysis. Among the top five markets in the Asia Pacific ( APAC ) region, Japan saw the strongest growth, with its value received onchain growing 120% year-on-year in the 12 months to June, according to an excerpt from Chainalysis’ 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report released on Wednesday. Chainalysis’ head of APAC policy, Chengyi Ong, told Cointelegraph that activity in Japan “reflects some of the trends that we saw in the global market, a sharp pickup in trading volumes in the fourth quarter of 2024 on the back of the US presidential election, followed by a tapering.” Meanwhile, Atsushi Kuwabara, chief business development officer at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, told Cointelegraph that the company had seen “steady growth in platform usage year over year” to August for both new and returning users. The value of crypto received by month in APAC shows an uptick in November 2024, coinciding with rising crypto prices after US President Donald Trump’s election win. Source: Chainalysis Japan has looked to reform its crypto laws to align the sector’s rules with the traditional securities market and change its taxation rules to lower taxes on crypto. Last month, the country’s regulators also greenlit the first stablecoin pegged to the yen. “Japan’s growth is on the heels of important advances in its crypto industry,” Chainalysis said. “For some time now, regulatory restrictions have constrained the listing of stablecoins on domestic exchanges, although this is now beginning to change.” A crypto ATM inside a mall underneath the popular tourist attraction Tokyo Tower. Source: Coin ATM Radar Ong said that market activity in Japan “has been stable but subdued relative to regional peers like South Korea,” but crypto use in the country “is likely to be boosted by expectations of upcoming policy changes.” “It is not surprising that there would be a pickup amid expectations of a more favorable policy and tax environment for crypto trading in the future.” APAC region sees continued crypto expansion Chainalysis’ report added that the growth in crypto value received doubled in Indonesia, South Korea and India, which showed “continued expansion but from already high baselines,” while a 55% growth in Vietnam suggested a “maturing market where crypto is already deeply embedded in remittances and everyday financial activity.” The annual percentage growth of crypto value received from July 2024 to June by country. Source: Chainalysis The company noted its report earlier this month found the Asia Pacific was the “fastest-growing region in the world in terms of onchain value received,” with India topping its Global Adoption Index. In the future, the markets “will be keenly watching” how stablecoins such as USDC ( USDC ) and the recently greenlighted JPYC gain traction, Chainalysis said. Stablecoins are a boon to the region’s adoption Ong said that stablecoins are “becoming a key component in APAC’s crypto adoption trends,” and are prominent across several of the region’s markets. She added that South Korea, in particular, saw banks take a “keen interest” in the development of stablecoin laws, and Chainalysis reported that stablecoin trading volumes jumped by over 50% early this year, with total purchases reaching $59 billion in the year to June. “USD-backed stablecoins have gained significant traction in that market,” Ong said. “It will be interesting to see whether that dynamic shifts when we eventually get won-backed stablecoins.” Related: Peso in freefall: US lifeline to Argentina met with Bitcoiners’ doubt She added that Australia “will also be an interesting one to watch in the future” with its recent shift in its treatment of stablecoins. “Even though legislation has been slow to materialize, regulators recently licensed one stablecoin under the existing financial services regime, and took steps to facilitate usage by granting regulatory relief to distributors,” Ong said. Crypto use case differs widely by country Chainalysis reported that the top five growing markets in the region had “strikingly different pathways into crypto,” with each having differing use cases; however, remittances were a recurring theme. India saw young adults use crypto to trade to boost their income, while a large number of Indians outside of the country used crypto for remittances. Vietnam also used crypto as “everyday infrastructure for remittances, gaming, and savings rather than speculation.” Pakistan, meanwhile, has a “young, mobile-first population” that uses stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and for payments, while South Korea traded crypto “almost like equities” as new laws are “reshaping activity on major domestic exchanges,” Chainalysis said. It added that the so-called “smaller markets” of Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong saw steps to align policy and regulatory regimes, aiming for greater and clearer oversight of the sector.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking to allow tokenized assets, including stablecoins, to be used in derivatives markets as collateral in a move supported by crypto executives. CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham said on Tuesday that her agency will “work closely with stakeholders” on the scheme and is encouraging feedback on using tokenized collateral in derivatives markets until Oct. 20. “The public has spoken: tokenized markets are here, and they are the future. For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets.” If implemented, stablecoins like USDC ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ) would be treated similarly to traditional collateral like cash or US Treasurys in regulated derivatives trading. Congress passed laws earlier this year regulating stablecoins, which have seen their adoption grow among financial institutions. Source: Caroline Pham Stablecoin, crypto heavyweights back move Crypto executives from stablecoin issuers Circle Internet Group, Tether, Ripple Labs and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com all gave their stamp of approval for the CFTC’s move. Circle president Heath Tarbert said that the GENIUS Act “creates a world where payment stablecoins issued by licensed American companies can be used as collateral in derivatives and other traditional financial markets.” “Using trusted stablecoins like USDC as collateral will lower costs, reduce risk, and unlock liquidity across global markets 24/7/365,” Tarbert added. US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July. It’s geared toward establishing clear rules for payment stablecoins, but is still awaiting final regulations before implementation. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal also backed the initiative, and said in a X post on Tuesday that “tokenized collateral and stablecoins can unlock US derivatives markets and put us ahead of global competition.” Source: Paul Grewal Meanwhile, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, said the CFTC’s plan is a key step toward integrating stablecoins into the “heart of regulated financial markets,” and driving greater efficiency and transparency in derivatives markets. “Establishing clear rules for valuation, custody, and settlement will give institutions the certainty they need, while guardrails on reserves and governance will build trust and resilience.” Initiative in works since early 2025 Pham said the tokenized asset initiative will build on the CFTC’s Crypto CEO Forum and is also part of the previously announced crypto sprint to apply the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets recommendations. The crypto CEO forum in February called for crypto industry CEOs to provide input on an upcoming digital asset pilot program and discussed the use of tokenized non-cash collateral.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated the central bank’s delicate balancing act, stressing that policymakers are trying to navigate between their price stability and employment mandates following last week’s interest rate cut. “Recent data show that the pace of economic growth has moderated,” Powell said in prepared remarks at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce’s economic outlook luncheon in Rhode Island, adding: The unemployment rate is low but has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and the downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. He added that a clearer trade policy means tariffs will likely trigger only a “one-time pass-through” effect on inflation. That may be interpreted as a slight shift from earlier warnings that tariffs could fuel more sustained cost pressures in the second half of the year. His comments echoed those of Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, who told the Kentucky Bankers Association’s annual convention on Tuesday: “The US economy has been resilient, but I am concerned about the weakening in labor market conditions and softer economic growth.” Powell cautioned that there is no risk-free path for interest rates, with elevated inflation on one side and rising unemployment on the other. He suggested, however, that the Fed is increasingly inclined to prioritize its employment mandate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted last week to lower interest rates by 25 basis points — the first cut in nine months and a move widely expected by markets. While Powell declined to comment on the likelihood of another reduction in October, expectations are high that the Fed will cut at its final two meetings of 2025. Fed funds futures are pricing in a strong likelihood of additional rate cuts in October and December.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ripple and the tokenization platform Securitize have integrated the Ripple USD stablecoin as an off-ramp for tokenized funds by major crypto investment firms BlackRock and VanEck. Ripple and Securitize launched a smart contract allowing holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s Treasury Fund (VBILL) to exchange their tokenized shares for the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. The smart contract allows BUIDL and VBILL investors to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD at any time, enabling additional onchain transfers. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said. RLUSD built for institutional use Launched by Ripple in early 2025, the RLUSD stablecoin is designed for enterprise focus and has been accepted by some global authorities for asset tokenization. In June, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved RLUSD support in the Dubai Land Department’s real estate tokenization initiative. Total RWAs onchain are estimated at $30.3 billion. Source: RWA.xyz “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, adding: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” RWAs on Securitize accumulate $4 billion The integration of RLUSD for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds came as tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Securitize accumulated to about $4 billion, according to its website. BlackRock’s BUIDL was the first tokenized fund issued by the firm in March 2024, allowing qualified investors on Securitize to earn US dollar yield by subscribing to the fund. In one year after launch, BUIDL surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, marking a significant milestone in the growth of the tokenization ecosystem. VanEck’s VBILL fund launched in May 2025, offering investors exposure to tokenized US Treasury-backed assets, initially available on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A $20 billion South African asset manager has been warning their investors from investing too much in their Bitcoin exchange-traded fund due to its price volatility. In an interview on Monday, Magda Wierzycka, the CEO of Sygnia, told Bloomberg TV that the company will intervene to ensure clients don’t shift too much of their portfolio to its ETF, Sygnia Life Bitcoin Plus , which is benchmarked off BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. However, she later acknowledged that Bitcoin could be turning into a long-term play. Wierzycka said the primary concern from Sygnia, the second-largest multi-manager in South Africa, is Bitcoin’s price volatility . “The underlying asset is highly volatile. You need to be very sure about the messaging around it and you need to be sure that you don’t make promises that you can’t meet.” In its fact sheet, the company also advises keeping investments in the Bitcoin vehicle at no more than 5% of discretionary assets or retirement annuities. Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka said the firm intervenes to ensure clients don’t shift too much of their portfolio to its ETF.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the US Federal Reserve will have a hard time cutting the interest rate unless inflation drops, and isn’t worried about stablecoins posing a threat to the banking sector. “If inflation does not go away, it’s going to be hard for the Fed to cut more,” Dimon, the head of the largest bank in the US, told CNBC-TV18 on Monday. “Inflation seems a little bit stuck at 3%. Again, I can give you some arguments why it’s going to go up, not down,” he said, adding he’s hopeful for “decent growth” and a rate cut instead of the Fed cutting rates due to a recession. Market expects multiple rate cuts Dimon’s expectation has thrown some cold water on the market’s expectation of multiple rate cuts, with some expecting up to five cuts over the next 12 months. Interest rate cuts have typically been a boon for crypto markets, as cheaper borrowing gives investors confidence to bet on riskier assets. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday for the first time in 2025, which spurred Bitcoin ( BTC ) to over $117,500 for the first time in more than a month.

The latest US inflation data released on Sept. 11 showed inflation rose 0.4% in August, marking a 2.9% rise over the last 12 months, above the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2%. Dimon “not particularly worried” about stablecoins Dimon separately weighed in on stablecoins , which have become a key policy issue for banks after Congress passed laws regulating the tokens in July. Dimon said he’s “not particularly worried about” stablecoins, but his bank and others in the sector “should be on top of it and understand it.” Related: ‘Uptober’ rally questioned as crypto markets turn red 9 days out “There’ll be people who want to own dollars through a stablecoin outside the US, from bad guys to good guys to certain countries where you’re probably better off having dollars and not putting into the banking system,” he said. He reiterated that JPMorgan is involved in stablecoins and the banking sector is “looking at whether they should have a consortium” to launch a token. “I’m not sure central banks need to use it among themselves, so it’ll develop over time,” he said. Banking groups have urged Congress to tighten up the stablecoin laws, claiming loopholes allow stablecoin issuers and their affiliates to pay interest or yields on stablecoins, arguing that it could undercut bank accounts and destabilize the banking system .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A crypto asset management firm that holds HYPE — the token behind decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid —  has proposed cutting the total supply of HYPE by 45% to make its tokenomics more attractive to investors. In a post to X on Monday, DBA Asset Management investment manager Jon Charbonneau outlined three changes to Hyperliquid’s economic model: Revoking authorization for all unminted HYPE tokens for future emissions and community rewards (FECR), burning all HYPE in Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund (AF), and removing HYPE’s 1 billion supply cap. His proposal was co-authored by pseudonymous crypto researcher Hasu. While the plan would need to be voted on and passed through Hyperliquid’s governance structure, DBA would be a major participant, given that it actively stakes HYPE and holds a material position in the token. Source: Jon Charbonneau The DBA executive said the proposed change would seek to correct the market’s misvaluation of HYPE, which he said is distorted by the fully diluted valuation metric that includes unissued tokens. “This is problematic because the market penalizes this excess supply in valuing the protocol, and pre-allocating these tokens may unduly bias future capital allocation decisions,” he said, adding that the change would make HYPE even more appealing to investors and stakers, while preserving the protocol’s ability to fund initiatives through new issuances. The proposal — which would see 421 million HYPE from the future emissions and community rewards category and 21 million from the assistance fund slashed — comes amid a recent uptick in investor interest in the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Within a week of revealing its new US dollar stablecoin, USDH, Hyperliquid opened a vote to decide who would issue the stablecoin, drawing interest from Paxos, Frax, Sky, Agora and Native Markets , which came out victorious last week. Hyperliquid handled $330 billion in trading volume in July with a team of 11 people, making it one of the industry’s most efficient platforms. Charbonneau noted that USDH would contribute significantly to Hyperliquid’s revenue when rolled out. Other institutional crypto investors support DBA’s proposal Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi agreed with Charbonneau’s take, stating that the nearly 50% community allocation is an “amorphous slush fund” for Hyperliquid governance members to figure out what to do with at a later date. Qureshi said it was fine to spend tokens on growth incentives as long as it is done transparently, but allocating nearly 50% of the total supply “to do whatever with is silly and we should end it.” Charbonneau’s proposal met with criticism Crypto pundit Mister Todd described the proposal as “absolutely foolish and a disaster,” stating that future emissions are the most powerful growth tool that Hyperliquid has at hand. Related: Hyperliquid whale withdraws $122M HYPE tokens as Arthur Hayes exits Others suggested that Hyperliquid should always have tokens set aside in the event of a fine or sanction from the Department of Justice or similar entity. However, Charbonneau countered both claims that the proposal doesn’t reduce the HYPE available in such a scenario; rather, it just changes the accounting of it. Source: Jon Charbonneau HYPE cooled off after rallying to a new high It comes as HYPE soared to a new all-time high of $59.30 on Thursday, while the rest of the crypto market continues to trend downward and sideways. HYPE has, however, fallen more than 22% to $46.08 since then, as market sentiment cooled and investment firms like Arthur Hayes-led Maelstrom Fund offloaded their entire HYPE holdings. Hayes said the firm sold its HYPE holdings in anticipation of selling pressure from nearly $12 billion worth of token unlocks over the next 24 months.

They also noted that under President Donald Trump’s August executive order on “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” the SEC was instructed to make alternative assets like crypto more accessible in participant-directed retirement plans, in consideration of accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules. “We are hopeful that such actions will help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,” the nine lawmakers said.

The company will rebrand as AVAX One and aims to raise $550 million to build a treasury centered on Avalanche ( AVAX ), the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. According to a Monday press release , the company’s goal is to accumulate more than $700 million in AVAX tokens. As a long-term strategy, it also plans to acquire and integrate revenue-generating fintech businesses into the Avalanche network. The funding strategy includes a $300 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, subject to shareholder approval, and plans to raise another $250 million through equity-linked instruments. Hivemind Capital is leading the raise, joined by more than 50 backers ranging from institutional firms to crypto-native players, including ParaFi, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, Big Brain Holdings, and FalconX.

Source: Yahoo Finance The company’s advisory board will be led by Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and a prominent crypto investor, and Brett Tejpaul, the head of Coinbase Institutional. Matt Zhang, Founder of Hivemind Capital and nominated chairman of the board at the company, told Cointelegraph that Avalanche was “a very deliberate choice.” He said his team had turned away “four other blockchain foundations, and that they “chose Avalanche for one reason: its relentless focus on onchain finance and world-class partnerships.” Zhang also noted that staking, the act of locking up crypto to secure a blockchain and earn yield in the process, played an important role in Avalanche's selection. “Staking is what makes us a real, operating business from day one, not just a passive treasury. It’s a critical part of our strategy. Based on our model, the revenue generated from staking makes the business profitable from the start,” Zhang said. AVAX was trading at $31.76 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. At that price, a $700 million investment would amount to about 22 million AVAX tokens. With validators currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of about 6.7% from staking, the position could generate around $46.9 million in yearly rewards. The announcement comes less than two weeks after the Avalanche Foundation revealed plans to raise $1 billion for digital asset treasury companies and AVAX accumulation initiatives.

Each Semler share will be exchanged for 21.05 shares of Strive Class A stock, representing a 210% premium over Semler’s pre-deal price. Alongside the merger, Strive disclosed it had purchased 5,816 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for about $675 million, boosting its total holdings to 5,886 BTC. Before the acquisition, Strive was a relatively minor player in the Bitcoin treasury space, with just 70 BTC on its books.

The Strive–Semler Scientific merger comes amid the rise of digital asset treasury companies, which have accumulated billions of dollars in Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, other cryptocurrencies such as Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). According to Standard Chartered, the deal may also underscore a broader trend: compressed market net asset values (mNAVs), which can increase financial risks and make expansion more difficult. For crypto treasurers, mNAV represents the ratio of a company’s enterprise value to its digital asset holdings. When this ratio falls below 1, expanding reserves becomes more difficult and riskier, particularly if funded through debt. The mNAV of digital asset treasury companies has compressed since June: Standard Chartered Standard Chartered recently noted that industry consolidation is likely under these conditions, with larger, more liquid players positioned to weather volatility and raise capital for acquisitions. If mNAVs remain depressed, the bank said, stronger companies could move to acquire weaker rivals. HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao recently cautioned that only crypto treasury companies with a long-term strategy will “survive any market,” emphasizing the importance of building lasting value rather than chasing short-term gains. “Digital assets themselves are not inherently unsustainable; it is how they are managed that makes the difference,” Chao told Cointelegraph .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A group of Democratic senators in the US Congress has signaled its intention to work with Republicans on advancing legislation to establish a digital asset market structure framework. In a Friday statement, 12 Democrats, including members of the Senate Banking Committee and Senate Agriculture Committee, issued a statement ahead of an expected vote on a crypto market structure bill pushed by Republican leadership. “We hope our Republican colleagues will agree to a bipartisan authorship process, as is the norm for legislation of this scale,” the statement reads. “Given our shared interest in moving forward quickly on this issue, we hope they will agree to reasonable requests to allow for true collaboration.” Though Republicans hold a majority in both chambers of Congress, they could still need some Democratic support to pass legislation. Among the Democrats’ proposed “seven key pillars” for a market structure bill released about two weeks ago were protections to fight illicit finance and “closing the gap in the spot market” for digital assets not considered securities. They also asked Republicans to support “preventing corruption and abuse” and illicit finance. Related: Key Republican senator expects Democratic support for US crypto market structure bill A top Democrat on the banking committee, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, did not sign onto the statement with the 12 other lawmakers.

Though the US House of Representatives passed its version of market structure under the CLARITY Act in July, Senate Republicans have signaled they will build on the legislation to draft a different bill. This bill, tentatively called the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, is expected to go for a vote in the Senate Banking Committee by the end of September, according to Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis. Republicans expect the bill to be considered by the banking and agriculture committees before heading for a floor vote by the end of the year.

The state can also loan out cryptocurrency to generate additional returns if it doesn’t increase financial risk.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Investors piled into the first Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and XRP ( XRP ) exchange-traded funds in the US on their debut trading day, blasting through analysts’ trading volume expectations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X that most new ETFs see around $1 million in trading volume, but the new crypto funds were “no slouch,” together seeing $54.7 million in trades over the day. Asset issuers REX Shares and Osprey Funds together launched ETFs on Thursday tracking the price of the third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP, and the eighth-largest cryptocurrency and largest memecoin, Dogecoin. Balchunas added that the volumes were a “good sign for the onslaught” of crypto-related ETFs that are awaiting regulatory approval to launch. Issuers have filed dozens of crypto ETFs tied to speculative altcoins or with novel instruments such as staking . XRP ETF trades near $40 million The REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), which tracks XRP, saw $37.7 million in volume, according to data from Balchunas and Cboe. Balchunas said it has the “biggest day one” in terms of monetary volume “of any 2025 launch.” Source: Eric Balchunas XRPR was a fast gainer out of the gate, as Balchunas had earlier noted that the ETF took in $24 million in volume within its first hour and a half on the market. “That is way more than I would have thought,” he said. “For context, it’s 5x more than any of the XRP futures ETFs did on Day One and it’s only been 90min.” Dogecoin ETF also performs well Earlier on Thursday, Balchunas said he expected that the Dogecoin-tracking REX-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE) would see $2.5 million in volume on the day, which he said would be respectable but “nothing too special.” He later said that his expectation was “destroyed in the first hour of trading” as the ETF neared $6 million in volume. “That’s shockingly solid,” he said. ”Most ETFs trade under $1m on Day One.” DOJE finished trading on Thursday with $17 million in volume traded, which Balchunas added would land it among the top five out of over 700 ETF launches this year. ETF types didn’t dissuade investors REX and Osprey filed their two ETFs under a securities law different from the laws under which most existing crypto-tied exchange-traded products were launched.

XRPR and DOJE don’t directly hold crypto but instead invest in a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary that does. They also buy shares in foreign exchange-traded products based in Europe and Canada that track XRP and DOGE to try to track the asset’s price.

The company announced Thursday that it is integrating the Morpho lending protocol, with vaults curated by DeFi advisory company Steakhouse Financial, directly into the Coinbase app. The move will allow users to lend USDC without navigating third-party DeFi platforms or wallets. Coinbase already pays up to 4.5% APY in rewards for holding USDC on its platform. With the new DeFi lending option, however, users can tap into onchain markets and potentially earn yields of up to 10.8% as of Wednesday, according to Coinbase. “Coinbase is only integrated with one lending protocol (Morpho) for this offering,” a company spokesperson told Cointelegraph. “We recommend that users understand the risks of lending, which are outlined in the Coinbase app experience.” Morpho ranks among the largest decentralized lending protocols in crypto , with more than $8.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama.

In August, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) — a lobbying group backed by major US banks — urged regulators to close what it described as a loophole that might permit exchanges or affiliates to provide yield through third-party partners. Source: Bank Policy Institute “Bank deposits are an important source of funding for banks to make loans, and money market funds are securities that make investments and subsequently offer yield.

The pushback comes as stablecoin adoption accelerates, with circulating supply recently surpassing $300 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Coinbase, meanwhile, rejected claims that dollar-pegged stablecoins undermine traditional banking. “Stablecoins don’t threaten lending — they offer a competitive alternative to banks’ $187 billion annual swipe-fee windfall,” the exchange wrote in a Tuesday blog post.

Brera, a sports ownership group with football clubs in Italy and across Europe, said Solmate will shift its core focus to a Solana-based digital asset treasury (DAT) and infrastructure business, accumulating and staking Solana ( SOL ) while also building validator operations in Abu Dhabi. Marco Santori, a partner at Pantera Capital and former chief legal officer at Kraken, will lead the company, with economist Arthur Laffer and RockawayX CEO Viktor Fischer joining the board alongside two seats reserved for the Solana Foundation.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved standards that could speed up spot crypto ETF approvals, as each application would not need to be assessed individually. The decision, detailed in SEC filings on stock exchanges like the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX, on Wednesday, would streamlines the process under Rule 6c-11, significantly reducing approval timelines, which have taken several months in the past. “By approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets,” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a separate statement. ”This approval helps to maximize investor choice and foster innovation by streamlining the listing process and reducing barriers to access digital asset products within America’s trusted capital markets.” It comes as spot ETF applications for the likes of Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) await official approval. The SEC was facing deadlines from October onwards to decide on those cases, in addition to a handful of others, including Avalanche ( AVAX ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Polkadot ( DOT ) and BNB ( BNB ). The development was viewed as bullish by many industry pundits, including Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who said: “This is the crypto ETP framework we’ve been waiting for.” He expects a wave of crypto investment products to launch in the US in the coming weeks and months.

The move builds on record trading activity in Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) futures contracts since their launches earlier this year, according to the exchange. It also marks the first time CME has extended its options offering beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ). Futures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a future date, while options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell those futures at predetermined prices. The options contracts will cover standard and micro-sized SOL and XRP futures, with daily, monthly and quarterly expiries. The new derivative products are subject to regulatory approval. Giovanni Vicioso, CME’s global head of cryptocurrency products, said the expansion reflects “significant growth and increasing liquidity” in crypto futures markets.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a consultation paper on Wednesday, setting out minimum standards that crypto companies must meet once the industry is formally brought under its remit. The regulator said the rules are designed to balance innovation and competitiveness with protections for consumers and market integrity. “We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector, balancing innovation, market integrity and trust,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance. Geale said that while the proposals will not erase crypto investing risks, they will help companies meet common standards so consumers have a better understanding of what to expect. FCA seeks consultation to deliver tailored crypto rules The FCA said that many of the requirements are similar to obligations that apply to traditional financial institutions. This includes rules on operational resilience and controls against financial crime. The regulator also opened discussions on issues unique to crypto markets. The FCA is seeking comments on whether the UK’s Consumer Duty, which mandates financial firms to deliver good outcomes for consumers, should also apply to crypto companies and crypto asset activities. Feedback is due in October and November, with final rules for crypto firms scheduled to be published in 2026. The regulator also seeks views on how crypto-related complaints should be managed, including whether consumers can refer them to the Financial Ombudsman Service, the UK’s official body for settling disputes between financial companies and consumers. The proposals come after His Majesty’s Treasury — the UK’s finance and economic ministry — published its draft legislation in April.

They added that the perpetual futures are priced with multiple institutional liquidity providers and settled in US dollars via bank rails. The Pyth index, the largest first-party oracle for financial data, serves as the price oracle. “The funding rate reflects the weighted average price difference between the perpetual future and the spot price and is applied automatically every eight hours to align the contract price with the spot price,” the spokesperson said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A “third mandate” from the US Federal Reserve could change long-term monetary policy if actioned, which could be bad news for the dollar but good news for crypto. The Fed has long been considered to have a dual mandate —  price stability and maximum employment — but President Donald Trump’s pick for Fed governor , Stephen Miran, cited a “third mandate” earlier this month, sparking speculation on the future of central bank monetary policy. The third mandate is a statutory requirement buried in the Fed’s founding documents, which states that the central bank actually requires three objectives: maximum employment, price stability and moderate long-term interest rates. The Trump administration appears ready to use this forgotten statutory requirement as justification for more aggressive intervention in bond markets, potentially through yield curve control or expanded quantitative easing and money printing, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The 1913 Federal Reserve Act notes a third mandate (highlighted) for moderate long-term interest rates. Source: US Government Publishing Office Lowering long-term interest rates This third goal has been largely ignored for decades, with most considering it a natural byproduct of achieving the first two, but Trump officials are now citing it as legal cover for potential yield curve control policies, where the Fed buys government bonds to target a desired interest rate. Trump has long advocated for lower rates, calling Fed governor Jerome Powell “too slow” or “ too late ” in reducing them. Related: Crypto markets prepare for Fed rate cut amid governor shakeup The administration wants to actively suppress long-term interest rates, and potential tools include increased Treasury bill issuance, bond buybacks, quantitative easing or direct yield curve control. Lower long-term rates would reduce government borrowing costs as national debt hits a record $37.5 trillion. The administration also wants to stimulate housing markets by bringing down mortgage rates. Positive impact on crypto Christian Pusateri, founder of encryption protocol Mind Network, said on Wednesday that the third mandate is “financial repression by another name,” adding that it “looks a lot like” yield curve control. “The price of money is coming under tighter control because the age-old balance between capital and labor, between debt and GDP, has become unstable,” he said. “Bitcoin stands to absorb massive capital as the preferred hedge against the global financial system.” Outspoken BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes also said it was bullish for crypto, suggesting that yield curve control could send Bitcoin to $1 million.

This is intuitive, but it’s also backed up by ETF history,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a report on Monday. However, Hougan warned that the launch of a crypto ETF should not be confused with renewed hype for cryptocurrency. Crypto ETFs’ “mere existence” no guarantee of success “The mere existence of a crypto ETP does not guarantee significant inflows. You need fundamental interest in the underlying asset,” Hougan said. “I suspect ETPs built on assets like Bitcoin Cash will have a hard time attracting flows unless the asset itself finds new life,” he added. However, Hougan emphasized that launching ETFs positions the products to rally when “fundamentals start to turn,” as ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to allocate capital to crypto. Sygnum’s research head, Katalin Tischhauser, told Cointelegraph in February that there “is all this frothy excitement in the market about these ETFs coming, and no one can point to where substantial demand is going to come from.” Two new altcoin exchange-traded funds are expected to launch in the US this week, tracking XRP ( XRP ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ).

According to a Tuesday filing , the proposed ETF will track an index featuring companies from stablecoin issuers, infrastructure providers, payment processors, exchanges and retailers to regulated crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) with exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ). The index, which will go through quarterly rebalances, is split into two equally weighted sleeves: an equity sleeve and a crypto asset sleeve, each making up half of the fund. The equity sleeve will focus on companies most directly tied to stablecoins and tokenization, while the crypto asset sleeve will provide exposure to blockchain infrastructure that supports stablecoins and tokenization, including blockchain oracles. “To be eligible for inclusion in the Crypto Asset Sleeve of the Index, the Index Provider must determine, in its sole discretion, that an asset is a Crypto Asset,” the prospectus reads. The largest crypto ETP in the sleeve will be capped at 22.5%. The fund will face competition such as Nicholas Wealth’s Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), which also combines equities and crypto-linked exposure.

All three bills eventually passed with some bipartisan support. It’s unclear whether the engrossed House bill combining market structure and a CBDC ban would have any effect on the legislation being proposed in the Senate.

According to Bloomberg , which cited people familiar with the discussions, the DOJ is weighing whether to lift the requirement that Binance be overseen by an independent compliance monitor. The monitor was imposed for a three-year period as part of a $4.3 billion settlement Binance reached with the DOJ in 2023, following allegations of multiple compliance failures, including insufficient safeguards against money laundering. The 2023 DOJ settlement applied to Binance’s global operations, not its US affiliate, Binance.US, which operates as a separate legal entity. Source: Bloomberg Bloomberg also suggests this potential move is part of what appears to be an emerging DOJ trend toward reducing or ending external oversight in certain cases, although it is not yet clear how broadly that applies. Companies have often criticized the use of outside monitors, describing them as costly and disruptive.

According to Grewal, the DOJ should urge Congress to “step in and enact broad preemption provisions.” “When Oregon can sue us for services that are legal under federal law, something’s broken,” said Grewal in a Tuesday X post. “This isn’t federalism--this is government run amok.” Coinbase letter to Justice Department official. Source: Paul Grewal The letter followed an April lawsuit from Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who alleged Coinbase sold unregistered securities to state residents — claims similar to those in a federal case previously brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After the SEC dropped its lawsuit in February , several other US states’ securities agencies followed, including those in Vermont, South Carolina and Kentucky. According to Rayfield, individual US states “must fill the enforcement vacuum being left by federal regulators who are giving up under the new administration and abandoning these important cases.” Related: Oregon AG lawsuit against Coinbase calls XRP unregistered security In response to the Oregon lawsuit, Coinbase filed to get the case heard by a federal judge. The case was moved to the US District Court for the District of Oregon in June. The company also filed its own lawsuit in state court against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek in July, alleging the change in policy toward crypto “occurred entirely behind closed doors,” without “public hearings, debate, and eventual action” in the legislature. The lawsuit is scheduled for a status check hearing on Oct. 29. Congress is still moving forward on market structure Amid the Oregon and Coinbase lawsuits, lawmakers on the US Senate Banking Committee are expected to soon take up a vote on legislation to establish a digital asset market structure. The bill is expected to clarify the roles the US financial regulators, the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), would have over crypto regulation and enforcement. “The Department should submit a views letter urging Congress to adopt broad preemption provisions in any market-structure legislation,” Grewal said. “Any preemption provision should characterize federally regulated digital assets as exempt from state blue-sky laws, make clear that new state licensing and other state regulatory requirements do not apply to crypto intermediaries, and apply retroactively.” While Coinbase currently faces no active federal cases, the company filed a motion last week over a Freedom of Information Act request involving text messages from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The exchange has filed more than one request for information with the SEC amid a 2023 civil enforcement action — likely looking for evidence around its reasons for bringing a case against a crypto company over alleged securities.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED As the US Federal Reserve prepares to adjust interest rates on Wednesday, a broader shake-up at the central bank could have serious implications for crypto markets. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates tomorrow, in a move that traditionally signals a rally in crypto markets: Lower yields on assets like bonds mean riskier assets like crypto are more attractive. The expected rate cuts come amid a political battle and a new appointment to the Federal Reserve. US President Donald Trump’s administration has charged Fed governor Lisa Cook with mortgage fraud as it seeks her removal . Meanwhile, the Senate has confirmed White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to the board of governors. The charges against Cook and the effort to nominate an individual with ties to the administration could mean a less independent Federal Reserve, which plays an important role in setting crypto policy. Bitcoin price spiked in 2021-2022 amid low US interest rates. Source: Trading Economics What a political Federal Reserve means for crypto policy The Trump administration is seeking to remove Cook — a Biden-era appointee — as it aims to exert more control over the Federal Reserve. On Aug. 25, the White House X page posted a letter in which Trump fired Cook, accusing her of making false statements on one or more mortgage agreements. Cook denied the accusations and refused to step down. Her legal team said the charges were motivated by politics and that the White House is “scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach.” Cook herself said that it is “unprecedented and illegal.” On Monday, the appeals court in Washington blocked the White House from removing Cook from her position at the Federal Reserve. This will allow her to maintain her post while the case is pending. Trump sought to remove Cook on Aug. 25 “effective immediately.” Source: Rapid Response 47 This morning, Miran, an economist and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, who has also made some pro-crypto comments in the past, was confirmed by the Senate. His position is temporary — the term ends in January 2026 — but Miran has declined to commit to stepping down as a White House adviser should his term extend beyond Jan. 31. This has Democratic legislators worried that the Fed and its monetary policy agenda will be more beholden to Trump’s political goals. Related: Trump renews push to oust Fed’s Cook ahead of expected rate cut Aaron Brogan, founder of crypto-focused law firm Brogan Law, told Cointelegraph, “The Fed has great authority over banks, and ultimately, banks are quasi-regulators of the crypto industry by determining who can and cannot access financial services.” “That influence is unlikely to decrease with a less independent Fed, but the policy might. I would wager it would be more changeable and susceptible to public whims.” A politicized Fed is relatively uncharted territory. When asked what a less independent Fed means for US monetary policy, Brogan said, “Nobody knows.” “There is an assumption that a dependent Fed would have more liberal, profligate monetary policy simply because it is more responsive to public opinion, which is fickle. But since we haven’t seen it, it is pure speculation. In this administration, at least, Trump would cut rates.” Crypto market gets ready for Federal Reserve rate cut As lawmakers in Washington fight over the fate of the central bank, crypto markets are getting ready for the Fed’s meeting tomorrow, where it’s expected that they will cut rates. Kevin Rusher, founder of real-world asset (RWA) borrowing and lending ecosystem RAAC, told Cointelegraph that “markets are on edge.” “Resuming the cutting cycle begins to unlock the $7.2 trillion sitting in money market funds, as well as the trillions tied up in outstanding mortgage debt.” He predicted that liquidity would flow into alternative yield-generating investments like those in decentralized finance (DeFi) and RWAs. Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, told Cointelegraph that “high-beta layer 1s” like Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) are particularly affected by Fed interest rate changes. “These trade like growth tech — more sensitive to liquidity and risk appetite than BTC. Especially as interest rate cuts could potentially trigger additional capital injected in risk-on assets, investors could be looking at deploying additional capital into ETH’s ‘digital oil’ narrative or SOL’s adoption growth,” she said. She said that DeFi tokens are “relatively more attractive” when interest rates fall, boosting tokens tied to lending/DEX activity.” Bitcoin is “still the quality crypto” and less rate-sensitive to interest rate changes but can still move “around big policy surprises and liquidity turns.” The Kobeissi Letter wrote , “When the Fed cuts rates within 2% of all time highs, the S&P 500 typically loves it.” While immediate-term results were mixed, “in 20 of the last 20 times this has happened, the S&P 500 has ended higher 1 year later.” Bitcoin and gold soar after interest rate cuts. Source: Kobeissi Letter They expect the same outcome this time as well. “There will be more immediate-term volatility, but long-term asset owners will party.” “Gold and Bitcoin have known this.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED France’s warning that it may try to block cryptocurrency companies from operating in the country under licenses issued by other European Union member states — known as passporting — has raised questions about enforcement of the 27-nation bloc’s flagship crypto law. France’s securities regulator , the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), is considering a ban on crypto firms operating in France under licenses obtained in other member states, Reuters reported Monday. The move reportedly stems from the AMF’s concern that some crypto companies seek licenses in more lenient EU jurisdictions. The warning came less than a year after the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA ) took effect for crypto-asset service providers. MiCA was designed to create a harmonized framework across Europe and prevent the kind of regulatory arbitrage the AMF is flagging. While some legal experts see this as going against MiCA regulations, other industry watchers say it is technically feasible. Related: Standard Chartered venture arm to raise $250M for crypto fund: Report “MiCA was designed to create one harmonised framework and give firms access to a single regulated market across the EU. That promise is now under pressure,” said Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI). “From what we’ve seen, blocking passporting under MiCA is technically possible, though it comes with significant legal complexity.” The recent position papers highlight “growing tensions over how MiCA should be enforced, with national authorities taking diverging views on key supervisory questions,” she added. On Monday, France became the third country to call for the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to take over supervision of major crypto companies, after Austria and Italy, according to a position paper seen by Reuters journalists. Cointelegraph reached out to the ESMA but had not received a response by publication. Some of these proposals “require legislative changes to MiCA itself,” which would “reopen political negotiations and potentially bring fresh uncertainty to the industry,” said Markezic. Related: Nasdaq-listed Helius announces $500M funding for Solana treasury Blocking crypto license “passporting” goes against MiCA Other legal experts see the AMF’s threat as legally unfeasible under the MiCA regime. “Legally, the AMF cannot block a duly MiCA-licensed entity from operating in France,” according to Edwin Mata, lawyer and co-founder and CEO of asset tokenization platform Brickken. “The AMF can monitor conduct, raise supervisory concerns, and escalate cases to ESMA, but it cannot impose unilateral barriers,” for companies licensed under any member state, said Mata, adding: “MiCA is a regulation, not a directive, which means it applies directly and uniformly across all Member States.” The French security regulator’s messaging is more of a “warning” signaling that France will “will scrutinize whether firms are attempting to structure products under MiCA when they should in fact fall under MiFID II,” Mata said, referencing Europe’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) framework for securities markets. The main challenge for regulators is ensuring that crypto firms do not leverage the “lighter regimes” for financial instruments that should be classified as securities, added Mata.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto Finance, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse Group, launched a new off-exchange settlement solution to improve capital efficiency and trading flexibility for institutional crypto investors. The new product, Crypto Finance AnchorNote, allows institutions to trade on different platforms without moving their assets out of custody. It also helps them settle trades off-exchange and earn yields within a compliant, risk-controlled setup, according to a Tuesday announcement. “With Crypto Finance AnchorNote, we are closing a critical gap between custody and capital efficiency,” said Philipp Dettwiler, head of custody and settlement at Crypto Finance. The launch is initially focused on the Swiss market, with a broader European rollout expected in the near term. The system integrates BridgePort as a middleware layer to coordinate messaging across exchanges and custodians. “Together with BridgePort, we are delivering an integrated solution that allows institutional clients to operate securely, flexibly, and in real time,” Dettwiler added. AnchorNote allows institutions to pledge assets without moving them out of secure custody.

Update Sept. 16, 1:38 pm UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from an SC Ventures representative. Standard Chartered’s venture arm is preparing to launch a $250 million digital asset investment fund in 2026, signaling growing institutional appetite for digital assets. Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures plans to raise the capital to open the investment fund focused on digital assets in the financial services sector, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing operating partner Gautam Jain. Set to launch in 2026, the fund will be backed by Middle East investors, with a focus on global investment opportunities, Jain told Bloomberg. SC Ventures’ plan follows a wave of corporate treasury firms building long-term accumulation strategies, adding to expectations that more institutional inflows may enter the crypto market over the next several years. “Digital assets continue to be a high conviction theme for SC Ventures, evidenced through its digital asset-native ventures: Libeara, Zodia Markets, Zodia Custody and our existing digital asset investments,” a representative from SC Ventures told Cointelegraph, adding: “We are continually evaluating opportunities in the digital asset space, whether it is through investments made directly or through JVs.” In addition to digital asset opportunities, the firm is also “evaluating opportunities in dynamic regions, like the Middle East and Africa,” the representative added.

He didn’t specify whether those funds would include or focus on cryptocurrencies and financial technology. The news came shortly after Standard Chartered raised concerns over the falling market net asset value (mNAV) of digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which measures the ratio of a company’s enterprise value to its cryptocurrency holdings. Standard Chartered warned that numerous high-profile treasury firms have recently slipped below the critical one mNAV level, which signals that it is becoming harder for companies to issue new shares and accumulate cryptocurrencies, Cointelegraph reported on Monday. Digital asset treasuries’ mNAVs have been under broad pressure since June. Source: Standard Chartered “The recent collapse in DAT mNAVs will likely drive differentiation and market consolidation,” Standard Chartered said. “Differentiation will favour the largest in breed, cheapest funders and those with staking yield,” flashing an optimistic sign for large firms like Strategy and Bitmine, who can still raise capital through issuing low-cost debt.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Around 42% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply, or 8.3 million Bitcoin ( BTC ), could be “illiquid” by 2032 at the current rate of Bitcoin treasury firm buying, according to asset management firm Fidelity. In a report published on Monday, Fidelity identified two groups whose supply could be considered illiquid, with the criteria being that their Bitcoin supply has ticked up each quarter or at least 90% of the time for the last four years. Based on this, it found two cohorts: Long-term Bitcoin holders and publicly-traded companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin, the latter of which have been growing this year. Bitcoin’s illiquid supply means there is less available on the open market, which could be positive for the price of Bitcoin. “We estimate that this combined group will hold over six million Bitcoin by the end of 2025 — or over 28% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist,” said Fidelity. It found that long-term Bitcoin holders, defined as those who have not moved Bitcoin from their wallet in at least seven years, have not witnessed any decrease in supply since 2016. The second group, publicly traded companies holding at least 1,000 BTC, has also generally held strong on their Bitcoin holdings, only witnessing a single quarter of supply decrease in Q2 2022. This cohort may also increase in the future, as there are currently 105 publicly traded Bitcoin holding companies. Currently, the publicly traded companies hold more than 969,000 BTC, amounting to 4.61% of Bitcoin’s total supply, according to data from Bitbo. Bitcoin’s supply has changed drastically in the past 15 years. Source: Fidelity 42% of Bitcoin supply to become illiquid Looking ahead, Fidelity predicts that 8.3 million BTC could become illiquid by the second quarter of 2032. The firm arrived at the figure by assuming that the group of wallets holding BTC for at least seven years will continue to increase their supply at the same rate as in the past ten years. The firm did not factor in additional supply shortages created by additional public companies. “At the close of Q2 2025, Bitcoin’s circulating supply stood at roughly 19.8 million. Of that, we estimate that nearly 42% — or over 8.3 million Bitcoin — will be considered illiquid by Q2 2032.” Potential sell-off by whales The report highlighted that the two groups combined now hold Bitcoin worth $628 billion at an average price of $107,700, double last year, at the end of the second quarter.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust Company filed a status update in court, letting a federal court know they had reached a “resolution in principle” to resolve a securities case stemming from a 2023 complaint. In a Monday filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), the SEC and Gemini Trust said that, “subject to review and approval” by the commission, the two parties requested that all litigation in the civil case be indefinitely stayed. The filing stated that both parties would file another status report if the case weren’t resolved by Dec. 15. Source: SDNY The securities case against Gemini Trust and Genesis Global Capital began with a complaint filed by the SEC in January 2023. The commission alleged that Genesis and Gemini “engaged in an unregistered offer and sale of securities to US retail investors” between February 2021 and November 2022. The agreement in principle likely marked one of the last steps in the winding down of the case against the two firms after the SEC and Genesis announced a $21 million settlement in 2024. The agency, then under acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda, told Gemini in February that it would not recommend pursuing an enforcement action as part of a separate investigation against the company.

Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were financial and personal supporters of US President Donald Trump during his 2024 campaign and have continued to maintain close ties to the White House this year. The twins were present during the signing of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and reportedly pressed for Trump to reconsider the nomination of Brian Quintenz as chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The White House asked a Senate committee to delay a hearing on Quintenz’s nomination before it broke for an August recess, and, as of Monday, no other hearing had been scheduled. Last week, Quintenz released screenshots of texts between himself and the Winklevosses from July that suggested they were looking for certain assurances regarding enforcement actions if his nomination were to move forward.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED France warned it may try to block cryptocurrency companies operating locally under licenses obtained in other European countries, raising enforcement gap concerns regarding the European Union’s crypto regulatory framework. France’s securities regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), told Reuters Monday that it is concerned about potential regulatory enforcement gaps related to Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the world’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Concerned that some crypto companies may seek licenses in more lenient EU jurisdictions, the AMF is considering a ban on operating in France under MiCA licenses obtained in other member states. “We do not exclude the possibility of refusing the EU passport,” Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, the chair of AMF, told Reuters, adding that it’s “very complex,” akin to an “atomic weapon” for the market. Crypto companies are looking for a “weak link” in European jurisdictions that will provide a “license with fewer requirements than the others,” she added. Under MiCA, which took effect for crypto-asset service providers in December 2024, companies authorized in one member state can use this as a “passport” to operate across the 27-nation bloc. France’s warning highlighted fears that uneven standards could undermine the framework.

Austria’s Financial Market Authority and Italy’s financial markets regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, have also called for regulatory supervision to be transferred to ESMA.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency industry advocacy groups called on the Bank of England not to proceed with plans to limit individual stablecoin holdings. In a November 2023 discussion paper , the bank floated setting individual caps on digital pounds between 10,000 British pounds ($13,558) and 20,000 pounds and asked for feedback on a possible lower limit of 5,000 pounds. According to a Monday Financial Times report , industry groups criticized the plan, saying it would be difficult and expensive to implement and could leave the UK lagging behind other jurisdictions. Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase, reportedly said that the limits would be bad for UK savers and the pound itself. “No other major jurisdiction has deemed it necessary to impose caps,” he said. Stablecoin limits “don’t work in practice” Simon Jennings, executive director of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC), told the FT that “limits simply don’t work in practice.” Related: Crypto industry groups slam bankers’ push to rewrite GENIUS Act He added that “issuers don’t have sight of who holds their tokens at any given time, so enforcing caps would require a costly, complex new system.” Last week, Jennings told Cointelegraph that UKCBC would like to “establish a transatlantic corridor for payments in stablecoins ” between the UK and the United States. The Bank of England’s plan would limit the effectiveness of such a system. UK regulators fear that stablecoins could destabilize the traditional financial ecosystem. In early April, the UK Financial Policy Committee recognized that stablecoins and crypto markets have expanded significantly in the past year, drawing heightened regulatory attention. The committee noted at the time that “even with appropriate regulation, greater use of stablecoins denominated in foreign currencies could make some economies vulnerable to currency substitution.” Similar concerns were raised in other countries as well. Related: Bank of England governor warns against private stablecoin issuance Stablecoin-powered bank runs and currency substitution Earlier this month, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), called for policymakers to address gaps in stablecoin regulation. Among other remarks, she sounded the alarm that US stablecoin policies “could potentially result not just in further losses of fees and data, but also in euro deposits being moved to the United States and in a further strengthening of the role of the dollar in cross-border payments.” Banks also fear that they may not be able to compete with the convenience of stablecoins if they are allowed to pay yields to their holders. Citi’s Future of Finance head Ronit Ghose warned in late August that paying interest on stablecoin deposits could spark a wave of bank outflows similar to the money market fund boom of the 1980s. Some in the crypto industry suggested that banks should step up their game to compete. “If local banks are worried about competition from stablecoins, they should pay more interest on deposits,” Bitwise’s investment chief, Matt Hougan, recently said .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair continued steering the regulatory agency in a different direction than its previous enforcement-first policy toward the crypto industry. In an interview with the Financial Times published Monday, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the agency is departing from the aggressive enforcement actions common during the administration of former President Joe Biden and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. US cryptocurrency businesses can now expect preliminary notices of technical violations before any agency enforcement actions, Atkins told the FT. “You can’t just suddenly come and bash down their door and say uh-uh, we caught you, you’re doing something and it’s a technical violation,” Atkins said, adding that businesses can now expect to first receive a preliminary notice. The comments marked a sharp departure from the enforcement-heavy agenda of his predecessor, Gensler, who was often criticized for leading the agency’s approach to crypto of regulation by enforcement. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC initiated lawsuits against some of the biggest companies in the industry, including suing Ripple Labs in 2020, Terraform Labs in 2022 and cryptocurrency exchanges Binance , Coinbase and Kraken in 2023. Those cases cost the industry billions in legal fees.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED United States President Donald Trump has filed an appeal in the case involving Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a key interest rate decision by the central bank this week. Lawyers representing the Department of Justice on behalf of the president have appealed against a preliminary injunction issued by the district court on Sept. 9, regarding Trump’s decision to remove Cook from office. The administration argues that removal “for cause” is “a capacious standard that Congress has vested in the President’s discretion” and is not subject to judicial review. “When a statute gives a power of removal ‘for cause,’ without any specification of the causes, the removal decision is a matter of discretion and not reviewable,” it stated. President Trump attempted to remove Cook on Aug. 25 based on alleged “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct” concerning mortgage agreements, citing apparent misrepresentations in loan documents. Cook challenged this, arguing her firing exceeded presidential authority and violated her due process rights. The case has led to a significant legal battle over presidential removal powers and renewed concerns over the Fed’s independence, raising questions over the reliability of the US dollar. New documents back Cook’s case However, new evidence appears to have emerged that directly contradicts the Trump administration’s mortgage fraud claims. A May 2021 loan summary states that Cook’s Atlanta property was used for a vacation home, supporting her position that she properly disclosed it as a second home, not her primary residence, according to an NBC report on Saturday. The documents could mean that there may be no actual misrepresentation in her mortgage applications, weakening the government’s arguments.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin treasury companies are in vogue, and Africa has its first trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. While the launch of Africa Bitcoin Corporation promises to attract billions of South African rand from capital markets, its founders believe Bitcoin’s impact on the continent remains in grassroots, retail adoption. South Africa’s Altvest Capital grabbed headlines as it rebranded to Africa Bitcoin Corporation (ABC), the first publicly-listed company actively building a Bitcoin ( BTC )-based treasury on the continent. Africa Bitcoin Corporation has a lofty goal to raise $210 million to purchase BTC for its treasury. Source: ABC The company has a long-term goal to raise $210 million to buy Bitcoin using preferential share offerings and structured debt notes in the mould of the UK’s Smarter Web Company. Altvest announced its pivot into Bitcoin in February . Speaking exclusively on Cointelegraph’s Chain Reaction live X broadcast, ABC’s chairman Stafford Masie and CEO Warren Wheatley unpacked the details behind the inception of the company.

Wheatley said they aimed to tackle the “dysfunction” that exists in global capital markets, where smaller players don’t have the same ability to attract investment or access capital markets. Related: Metaplanet, Smarter Web add almost $100M in Bitcoin to treasuries How does Bitcoin fit into that picture? Wheatley said it’s a “natural evolution,” describing Bitcoin as the “ultimate alternative asset” that would galvanize the company’s balance sheet. Masie added that holding Bitcoin would allow ABC to continue investing and assist small enterprises in South Africa to raise capital and build their businesses. This would entail offering Bitcoin-backed financial services, including credit, savings and structured products. “In the context of all these Bitcoin companies, we’re not a pure play. We have an operating business that’s got immense opportunities. I think this Bitcoin play gives it more muscle relative to that,” Masie said. Bitcoin’s value proposition solves African problems The underlying principle for adopting a Bitcoin treasury reserve is directly tied to the reality facing many developing countries — devaluing local currencies and inflationary concerns. Masie said that Bitcoin holders in Europe, America and the Middle East largely view BTC as an alternative investment asset. In contrast, Bitcoin is hugely valuable as a medium of exchange and store of value in developing countries. “In Africa, when financial services don’t work, people die. We live that reality. That’s who we are. So when we approach Bitcoin, we approach Bitcoin from a real, human necessity, life-saving perspective,” Masie said. “Debasement is very real for us. People die because of that.” From a South African perspective, political uncertainty, fraud and corruption are challenges that businesses and individuals face daily. As Masie explained, the rising costs of daily necessities like food, water and electricity are more a symptom of monetary dysfunction than political disorder. “The money is broken, not the society. Your groceries are not getting more expensive; the money is getting weaker,” Masie said. Related: UK Bitcoin treasury company Smarter Web eyes acquisitions, FTSE 100 For ABC, the Bitcoin treasury play isn’t “just an opportunity from a pure financial instrumentation perspective,” it’s a human story. “If we can get this right, we can solve so many problems that are very inherent to Bitcoin’s value proposition. That’s why we say Bitcoin was made for us.” Masie added that while Bitcoin allows individuals to preserve monetary value far better than South Africa’s struggling Rand, the creation of the continent’s first publicly-listed Bitcoin treasury company presents a massive opportunity for capital markets to gain exposure to BTC. “We want to serve the individual that is not a cypherpunk, all the way through to the corporations and fixed income markets wanting exposure to the asset class but struggling to get exposure to it.” ABC announced phase 1 of its Bitcoin strategic reserve, raising 11 million rand ($633,000) so far. The company’s prospectus notes that its first phase aims to raise $11 million in total.

Related: UK’s Smarter Web Company raises $21M via Bitcoin-denominated bonds Profiting from the failure of competitors Webley’s comments about acquiring competitors follow reports that Bitcoin treasuries, especially new and smaller ones , are likely to encounter trouble. Coinbase head of research David Duong and researcher Colin Basco recently said that crypto-buying public companies are entering a “player vs player” stage that will see firms competing harder for investor money. They said that “strategically positioned players will thrive” and supercharge the crypto industry with their capital flow. Also, analysts said that this market segment is quickly becoming oversaturated and that many crypto treasuries will not survive in the long term . Josip Rupena, CEO of lending platform Milo and a former Goldman Sachs analyst, told Cointelegraph at the end of last month that crypto treasury companies mirror the risk of collateralized debt obligations , which played a key role in the 2008 financial crisis. “There’s this aspect where people take what is a pretty sound product, a mortgage back in the day or Bitcoin and other digital assets today, for example, and they start to engineer them, taking them down a direction where the investor is unsure about the exposure they’re getting,” he said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly exploring ways to tokenize exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the blockchain, following the strong performance of its spot Bitcoin ETFs. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg reported Thursday that the company is considering tokenizing funds with exposure to real-world assets (RWA). Any such move, however, would need to navigate regulatory hurdles. ETFs have become one of the most popular investment vehicles — so widespread, in fact, that they now outnumber publicly listed stocks, according to Morningstar . Tokenizing ETFs could potentially allow them to trade beyond standard market hours and be used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

It already manages the world’s largest tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) , which holds $2.2 billion in assets across Ethereum, Avalanche, Aptos, Polygon and other blockchains. JPMorgan has called tokenization a “significant leap” for the $7 trillion money market fund industry, pointing to the initiative launched by Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon, which BlackRock will join at launch. Under the initiative, BNY clients will gain access to money market funds with share ownership registered directly on Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain.

Source: RWA.xyz Amid blockchain push, TradFi moves to lock in dominance with money market funds The rise of tokenized money market funds isn’t happening in a vacuum but alongside mounting pressures on traditional finance — particularly from the rapid adoption of stablecoins and the shift of liquidity into blockchain-based markets. Cointelegraph reported in May that the US banking lobby was especially wary of yield-bearing stablecoins amid concerns that they could disrupt traditional banking models. Notably, such tokens were excluded from the US GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive legislation on stablecoins. Source: ayyyeandy In June, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds will likely keep attracting capital to the industry while enhancing their appeal as collateral. This, she noted, could help preserve “cash as an asset” in the face of stablecoins’ growing influence. “Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasurys, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds,” Ho told Bloomberg. Still, analysts say stablecoin growth under GENIUS will ultimately benefit tokenization by providing clearer rules and stronger on-ramps into blockchain markets.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Chainlink, a blockchain oracle provider, and UBS, a $5.9 trillion asset manager, have partnered with DigiFT for a pilot study to automate real-world tokenization funds. This feature could eliminate manual errors, according to the companies. If successful, the study could have implications for RWA tokenization in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. According to the announcement, the three groups are “developing a regulated blockchain-based infrastructure designed to automate and streamline the distribution, settlement, and lifecycle management of tokenized products [...].” The study is part of Hong Kong’s Cyberport Blockchain & Digital Asset Pilot Subsidy Scheme, a sandbox that tests new crypto ideas for future implementation in Hong Kong. According to the project’s workflow, investors first submit subscription or redemption requests for UBS’s tokenized products through DigiFT’s smart contracts. Those instructions are then processed by Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent contracts, which act as the infrastructure layer to verify the orders and record them directly onchain. Once processed, the orders trigger the corresponding issuance, redemption and other lifecycle events on UBS’s tokenized product contracts, which is said to follow the Capital Markets Technology Association (CMTA) Token standards, a framework developed in Switzerland to harmonize the issuance of digital securities. Some other crypto ideas under consideration in Cyberport are decentralized identity, payments and stablecoins, and blockchain for social innovation and digital experience. Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong has a clear regulatory framework for digital assets . However, it is still subject to China’s rules, such as the reported forthcoming crypto restrictions on Chinese companies operating in the administrative zone. DigiFT, an exchange that specializes in tokenized assets, is providing feedback on whether the technological implementation meets the compliance and interoperability requirements of the zone’s financial institutions. Manual reconciliation and adjustments of funds can result in tracking errors or situations where the value of a fund doesn’t equal the value of the underlying asset. Trends in automation of RWA tokenization funds include decentralized finance integrations and yield generation. Because automation can increase efficiency, implementing it can lower costs, which brings in more revenue for the fund operator or is passed on to the investors.

Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, which examines draft laws, told the state-owned news agency TASS on Tuesday that Russia should follow its ally Belarus in launching a crypto exchange service through a major financial institution. Masharov said the move would “solve a number of current problems,” such as bringing “shadow transactions” into the legal field while also “replenishing the federal budget’s income,” and blocking one of the “channels for financing and recruiting our citizens to commit serious crimes.” Russia banned payments via crypto in early 2022 , but it has become open to the sector as it looks to trade internationally and skirt the sanctions it faces for its invasion of Ukraine. It has so far allowed financial institutions to offer crypto-based products to accredited investors in May and floated plans for a Ruble-pegged stablecoin in April. Evgeny Masharov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, has proposed that the country create a crypto bank. Source: Oprf.ru Crypto bank could help miners too Masharov argued that a crypto bank could aid the country’s crypto mining industry, as there is currently no infrastructure for them to sell the crypto they’ve mined. Russia banned mining in 10 out of 46 Russian regions for six years on Jan. 1 and approved seasonal restrictions in key mining regions to help combat rising energy demands. However, Vyacheslav Kopylov, a representative of local crypto mining firm Prostomining, told Cointelegraph in June that despite the restrictions, the industry continues to thrive and Russia’s Blockchain Forum has increasingly featured businesses involved in crypto mining. A way to combat fraud Masharov said a crypto bank could help combat fraud as it would be a regulated institution overseeing all transactions. Related: Russia civic chamber proposes dedicated fund for confiscated crypto assets “In this case, settlements in the said bank must be made in cryptocurrencies, and funds must be credited only through the current accounts of Russian citizens,” he said. “At present, the main business of crypto exchangers is that cash is credited to the wallet of citizens and a commission is charged for this,” Masharov added. In March, Masharov proposed creating a government crypto fund that would include assets confiscated from criminal proceedings.

While CME FedWatch Tool data shows just 7.8% of market participants expect such a move at the Sept. 17 Fed meeting, Standard Chartered Bank recently raised its forecast to that level, citing August’s weaker-than-expected jobs report, according to a Reuters report on Monday. Crypto trader Mister Crypto said in an X post on Wednesday, “If that happens, crypto will explode through previous ATHs.” However, Solomon expects the Fed to follow the broader market consensus, with 92.2% of participants anticipating a smaller cut. “I’m pretty confident we’ll have a 25 basis rate cut,” Solomon said. Solomon points to the labor market “softening” “There’s no question that when you look at the labor market, there’s a little bit of a softening,” he added. Solomon anticipates potentially two more rate cuts this year, depending on macroeconomic conditions. “I think you could see one or two other cuts, depending on how economic conditions play out from here,” he said. Source: Ash Crypto This month’s Fed rate cut meeting is significant not just for the broader market but also for crypto, as lower interest rates make traditional investments like bonds less lucrative compared to riskier, higher-reward assets. However, sentiment platform Santiment recently warned that the surge in social media chatter around the highly anticipated September interest rate decision could be a warning sign for crypto. Crypto market may have priced in the Fed cut “Historically, such a massive spike in discussion around a single bullish narrative can indicate that euphoria is getting too high and may signal a local top,” Santiment said on Aug. 24 .

Cointelegraph previously reported that the Doge ETF was slated to debut on Thursday, with timing determined by its structure under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Unlike products filed under the Securities Act of 1933 — which was used to approve spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs last year — 1940 Act funds face a simpler path to market. “This is a ‘40 Act, which doesn’t directly invest fully in spot,” Balchunas said. “So long as the SEC doesn’t say anything, you can let it launch 75 days after filing.” Unless the SEC raises a last-minute objection, the funds are set to list this week, Balchunas said.

In a Wednesday meeting, the banking committee voted along party lines, 13 to 11, to advance Miran’s nomination to the full Senate for consideration. All Democrats voted against the potential Fed governor, while Republicans, in the majority, voted in favor. Miran, whom President Donald Trump picked to chair the Council of Economic Advisors in December, said during a hearing last week that he would not resign from his role advising the White House if his time as a Fed governor were extended past January. If confirmed, he would fill a term vacated by Fed member Adriana Kugler, ending on Jan. 31. The potential Fed governor said in a December interview that “crypto has a big role potentially to play in innovation,” but has not made any significant public statements on digital assets or blockchain since joining the Trump administration.

How Japan plans to fix its crypto tax rules From harsh 55% taxes to a flat 20%, Japan’s crypto overhaul promises relief for investors in a bid to boost Web3 innovation. Listen 0:00 How to COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways Japan plans to replace progressive crypto tax rates up to 55% with a flat 20% by fiscal year 2026. New rules will align digital assets with equities, adding safeguards against insider trading and unfair practices. Investors will gain three-year loss carry-forward provisions, which ease volatility and improve portfolio risk management. Japan shifts from strict post-hack regulations to a Web3-friendly framework that balances innovation with security. Japan is poised for a significant change in its cryptocurrency tax policies. Currently, investors must deal with a stringent system that taxes crypto transactions at steep rates — up to 55%. This policy has discouraged participation, driven many traders out of Japan and left crypto disadvantaged compared to stocks taxed at a flat 20%. However, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has committed to reforms that would introduce a more favorable flat tax rate for crypto. This could potentially transform Japan’s position as a global hub for digital assets. This article discusses how the ruling party in Japan has introduced crypto tax reforms and how these developments might impact its homegrown crypto market. Proposed crypto tax reforms and regulatory changes in Japan The proposed tax regime is likely to come into place in the financial year 2026, subject to parliamentary approval. This change will introduce a significant departure from the existing tax system. The reforms will also introduce equities-like insider trading regulations for cryptocurrencies , preventing unfair profits from private information, such as token listings or protocol changes, thereby strengthening market fairness. This tax reform is not a standalone measure but part of a wider economic strategy to align cryptocurrencies with traditional investments, making them competitive and well-regulated. The 2025 tax review may also incorporate investor-friendly measures, such as allowing three-year loss carry-forward provisions, bringing crypto in line with equities and providing crucial flexibility in a volatile market. Did you know? Bitcoin ( BTC ) was the first cryptocurrency ever traded, with its earliest exchange value in 2010 being just $0.003 per BTC. How the crypto tax reforms may herald a new era for traders in Japan Japan is shifting from one of the toughest tax regimes in crypto to a fairer, more investor-friendly system. The government sees this as a way to strengthen its role as a global hub for digital assets. Finance Minister Katsunobu Katō has openly endorsed crypto’s place in diversified portfolios. He noted its volatility but stressed that building the right environment could turn it into a legitimate investment option. He underlined the need for stability and transparency to build investor confidence. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has made these reforms part of its policy platform. The plan includes moving crypto to a flat-rate tax regime and extending equities-style oversight, signaling that digital assets now sit within Japan’s broader economic strategy. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing the details. Proposals include a flat 20% tax on crypto gains from fiscal 2026, three-year loss carry-forward rules and reclassification of crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. That change would allow enforcement of insider-trading rules and investor protections similar to those in traditional markets. Did you know? Leverage trading in crypto can reach up to 100x on some platforms, amplifying both profits and risks dramatically. Japan: From strict regulation to Web3 embrace In the aftermath of high-profile hacks, particularly the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the infamous Coincheck hack in 2018, Japan adopted some of the world’s strictest cryptocurrency regulations. The FSA enforced rigorous standards for crypto exchanges , custody services, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) practices and cybersecurity, prioritizing investor protection, even at the cost of innovation. Under former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan began shifting gears. As part of his broader “New Capitalism” and Web3 strategy, the government signaled an embrace of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) to retain domestic tech talent and stay competitive globally. Public consultations and legislative planning will follow to recalibrate Japan’s crypto policy, balancing security with innovation and Web3-friendly growth. Did you know? Automated bots handle a large share of crypto trades, using algorithms to exploit tiny market inefficiencies. Possible market impact of Japanese crypto reforms If Japan enacts its proposed tax reforms, both corporate and individual adoption of crypto will likely accelerate. Lower taxes and clearer rules could boost liquidity , attract institutional capital and encourage development in digital asset infrastructure. The reforms also tie into a larger goal: positioning Japan as a global digital finance hub to compete with crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore and the UAE . A regulated, investor-friendly environment would help draw global capital, stimulate domestic markets and strengthen Japan’s role in the Web3 economy. Optimism around these reforms is already visible. Metaplanet, Japan’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, was added to the FTSE Japan Index, a sign of growing mainstream acceptance. On Aug. 25, 2025, the company bought another 103 BTC, raising its total holdings to 18,991 BTC. Challenges and future outlook Several challenges confront Japan’s proposed cryptocurrency tax reforms, including the inherent volatility of digital assets, which prompts concerns about market stability and investor protection. Regulatory enforcement presents a further hurdle, as ensuring compliance with new insider trading rules requires robust oversight. Moreover, parliamentary approval for the 20% flat tax rate may encounter delays due to political debates or competing priorities. Japan’s planned 2026 reforms signal a major shift toward investor-friendly policy and a stronger global positioning of the country. These changes are expected to pave the way for a rapid growth of the Japanese crypto industry while fostering the emergence of yen-backed stablecoins like JPYC. With crypto reforms, Japan is laying the groundwork to become a leading regulated cryptocurrency hub in Asia, appealing to both retail and institutional investors with enhanced clarity, tax parity and infrastructure.

Kyrgyz lawmakers have passed amendments to a bill “On virtual assets” in three readings at once, officially cementing terms like “state crypto reserve” and “state mining,” the parliament announced on Wednesday. Presented by Economy and Commerce Minister Bakyt Sydykov, the bill addresses multiple aspects of Kyrgyzstan’s crypto adoption, including establishing a legal framework for the issuance and circulation of stablecoins , tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and state-run industry operations. “A crypto reserve would allow the state to accumulate its own assets in cryptographic form through crypto mining, as well as tokenization of real-world assets and issuance of stablecoins backed by fiat currency,” the minister reportedly said at a committee meeting earlier this week. Crypto reserve as a tool to increase financial stability According to Sydykov, a state crypto reserve would help Kyrgyzstan increase financial stability by diversification and adoption of new accumulation instruments. He also mentioned that the government will not be exempt from mining rates established by the state in response to concerns over possible issues related to Kyrgyzstan’s energy supply . Kyrgyzstan’s draft law on amendments to the bill “On virtual assets” passed three readings on Sept. 9 (translated by Google).

A mix of assets Following parliamentary readings, the draft bill is yet to be signed by Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov, who signed a law on central bank digital currency (CBDC) just a few months ago. According to the bill, Kyrgyzstan’s potential crypto reserve would not solely rely on pure crypto assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), but would rather represent a combination of digital assets owned by the state. Related: UK sanctions Kyrgyz banks, $9.3B crypto network tied to Russia “A state cryptocurrency reserve is a set of virtual assets owned by the state and formed through their mining, issuance, tokenization and acquisition,” the bill text reads, adding: “The procedure for the formation, storage, management and use of the cryptocurrency reserve is determined by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic.” Kyrgyzstan’s moves with state crypto asset reserve came amid neighboring countries like Kazakhstan aggressively exploring similar initiatives as well.

Cboe Global Markets, a derivatives exchange under the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said on Tuesday that it will launch the product on Nov. 10, pending regulatory review. The continuous futures in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) will offer US traders “single, long-dated contracts with a 10-year expiration, reducing the need to roll positions over time and simplifying position management.” Unlike traditional futures contracts that may require periodic rolling, continuous futures function like perpetual contracts , which have no expiry date and are popular in DeFi and offshore exchanges Cash-settled contracts Cboe’s contracts will be aligned to the spot prices of BTC and ETH using transparent funding and cash settled. “Perpetual-style futures have gained strong adoption in offshore markets.

The new company will be renamed to Strive, Inc. and continue trading under the ticker ASST.

The new firm is the latest addition to the 186 public companies reporting large-scale Bitcoin buys, which has grown from less than 100 at the start of the year and sparked concerns of an oversaturated market. Strive tries reverse-merger for $1.5 billion Bitcoin buys The trend of public crypto-buying companies has fueled Bitcoin’s price rally to $124,450 as companies tap equity, convertible debt, perpetual stock, and, more recently, Special Purpose Acquisition mergers to fund their plans. Strive opted for a reverse-merger structure, which is considered safer than the faster-paced SPACs as it relies less on speculative capital raises, dilution, and uncertain deal timelines. Strive plans to fund its $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchases with $750 million from a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE), plus another $750 million that could come from the exercise of warrants issued in the PIPE. The $1.5 billion planned raise would allow the company to buy 13,450 Bitcoin at current market prices, putting it in the top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holding companies. The merger’s closing is contingent upon certain conditions, including clearance of Strive’s listing application by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Strive had eyes on Mt. Gox Bitcoin When the merger was announced in May, Strive said it was looking to acquire 75,000 Bitcoin from claims tied to the collapsed crypto exchange Mt. Gox to buy the asset at a discount. Strive said the strategy could help boost its Bitcoin-per-share ratio, a measure increasingly used in the Bitcoin treasury space. However, a successful shareholder vote is needed to pursue the Mt. Gox claims.

On Tuesday, the SEC pushed back its deadline on NYSE Arca’s proposal to list the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. The application was first filed in March and published in the Federal Register on March 17, beginning the statutory review period. That same day, the agency also extended its review of Grayscale’s application to list the Hedera ETF, setting the same November deadline. Grayscale updated filings for its long-standing Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash trusts, seeking to convert them from trusts into ETFs. Moving the trusts to a national exchange would allow daily share creations and redemptions, keeping prices closer to net asset value and reducing the steep premiums and discounts seen in over-the-counter (OTC) trading. The company set the precedent in 2024 when it converted the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into the first US spot Bitcoin ETF after a court battle with the SEC. It is now looking to apply the same model to Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) and Litecoin ( LTC ). Related: How high can DOGE price go when a Dogecoin ETF is approved?

The issue price represents a 9.9% discount to Metaplanet’s Tuesday closing price of 614 yen. Source: Metaplanet The payment date is set for Sept. 16, when underwriters and investors will transfer funds to the company. The delivery date follows on Sept. 17, when the new shares will be credited to investors. The move represents an equity offering, not a bond issuance — meaning there is no coupon rate. Instead, new stock is being sold, increasing dilution risk for existing shareholders. Metaplanet said proceeds will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin ( BTC ) between September and October as a hedge against further depreciation of the Japanese yen, and to expand the company’s Bitcoin income-generating business, which has so far relied on trading BTC options. The move follows a string of Bitcoin purchases that have propelled Metaplanet into the ranks of the world’s largest public BTC holders, with 20,137 BTC on its balance sheet, according to industry data . Though Metaplanet remains officially classified as a hotel operator, it has been pivoting toward digital assets for more than a year. The company unveiled its Bitcoin treasury strategy in 2024 as a hedge against inflation, negative interest rates and the long-term effects of Japan’s national debt. Since then, it has repeatedly raised capital to acquire BTC — at the cost of further shareholder dilution. Metaplanet’s stock has surged more than 150% over the past year due to enthusiasm for its Bitcoin strategy.

Nevertheless, the strategy continues to gain traction, with dozens of companies pivoting toward digital asset treasury models.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A group of Democratic US senators has released its own version of guidelines to influence legislation to establish a crypto market structure, focusing on taking time toward a “strong, bipartisan outcome.” In a Tuesday notice, 12 Democratic senators, several of whom are on the banking committee, unveiled a framework for market structure legislation in response to Republicans’ plans. Like the Republicans’ latest draft released on Sept. 5 , the Democrats’ framework includes provisions for regulatory clarity and laying out rules by which the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could handle digital assets. “We owe it to the millions of Americans who participate in this market to create clear rules of the road that protect consumers and safeguard our markets,” the senators wrote. “We also must ensure that digital assets are not used to finance illicit activities or to line the pockets of politicians and their families.” With Democrats in the minority in the Senate, it’s unclear whether Republicans will consider the framework recommendations as part of their plans to pass the bill out of the banking committee by October, out of the agriculture committee by November and into law by 2026. Republican Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the banking committee, said in August that he expected “between 12 to 18” Democrats to back the majority’s version of the bill, titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. Related: US Congress seeks report ironing out details of Bitcoin reserve “Achieving a strong, bipartisan outcome will require time and cannot be rushed,” wrote the 12 Democrats. “We look forward to working on this with our Republican colleagues.” Addressing the current dearth of leadership at the CFTC The Democratic framework, which laid out “seven key pillars,” includes proposed protections to fight illicit finance and “closing the gap in the spot market” for digital assets not considered securities. However, the document also personally called out US President Donald Trump in recommendations to ensure “fair, effective regulation” over crypto markets. “Designing and enforcing a digital asset framework will require significant additional resources for the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury Department,” said the proposed framework. “In addition, President Trump has fired countless Democratic commissioners from independent regulatory agencies and shown little interest in nominating new officials.” The leadership at the CFTC currently consists of one commissioner, acting chair Caroline Pham, following the departure of all of the agency’s other heads this year. The Senate is expected to consider the nomination of Brian Quintenz, Trump’s pick to replace Pham as chair. Pham said she would leave the CFTC after the Senate confirms a replacement. As of Tuesday, Trump had not nominated anyone else to fill the remaining four seats at the commission. Chances of the bill passing by 2026? Following the passage of the GENIUS Act — a bill to regulate payment stablecoins — in July, the Senate is expected to address the market structure bill as one of its top priorities after breaking for a month-long recess. The House’s version of the legislation, called the CLARITY Act, passed with significant bipartisan support, while an anti-CBDC (central bank digital currency) bill received only two yay votes from Democrats. While many of the senators who signed onto the Tuesday framework voted to pass the GENIUS Act, it’s unclear whether that support will extend to market structure, particularly with the recommendations around “corruption and abuse.” The document recommends that any bill include limits on elected officials and their families from “issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets while in office” and strengthen disclosure requirements. In addition to their concerns over leadership at independent regulatory agencies, the Senate Democrats claimed Trump had “turned to digital asset projects to enrich himself and his family.” Trump’s ties to the industry through his family-backed crypto company World Liberty Financial, his personal memecoin and his family’s mining venture could complicate efforts to build bipartisan support for crypto legislation, particularly among Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has often criticized the president’s crypto ventures.

In a Monday notice, the SEC said the crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, would host a public roundtable on financial surveillance and privacy on Oct. 17. The event will mark the sixth roundtable focused on issues related to digital assets at the commission’s Washington, D.C., offices since the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Understanding recent developments in privacy-protecting tools will assist the SEC and other financial regulators as we work on policy solutions in the crypto space,” said Peirce. The crypto-focused roundtable events, which include a series of 10 meetings across the US starting in August and running through December, come as the SEC is considering proposed rule changes that could significantly impact market participants. On Thursday, the commission proposed “certain exemptions and safe harbors” related to the offer and sale of crypto assets and modifying “broker-dealer financial responsibility rules,” lessening the burden on US-operating crypto companies.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Nasdaq, the world’s second-largest stock exchange by market capitalization, is seeking regulatory approval from the US securities regulator to list tokenized stocks. Nasdaq filed a request Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asking for a rule change that would allow the company to list tokenized stocks. The exchange operator specifically asked to amend certain rules, including the definition of a security, to trade tokenized stocks under the same execution and documentation rules as traditional securities, provided the tokenized versions are deemed equivalent. According to a report by Bloomberg, Nasdaq’s request with the SEC would go beyond a technical rule change as it relates to the foundations of how stocks are issued and settled. Tokenized assets should be clearly labeled One of the changes sought by Nasdaq is that tokenized assets should be clearly labeled to ensure that all participants, including those responsible for clearing and settlement, like the Depository Trust Company, properly process these trades. “A security may be traded in the Nasdaq Market Center in either traditional form (a digital representation of ownership and rights, but without utilizing distributed ledger (‘blockchain’ technology)) or tokenized form (a digital representation of ownership and rights which utilizes blockchain technology,” the company stated in the filing.

If approved, US-regulated exchanges, including Nasdaq, would be authorized to list tokenized shares on their platforms, which could boost liquidity for blockchain-based versions of traditional securities. Nasdaq steps up against “siloed trading venues” In the filing, Nasdaq emphasized the importance of putting tokenized securities under the   purview of established securities markets players, opposing it to listings on “siloed trading venues,” where investors would have “no consolidated sense of best market-wide prices.” “Although tokenization technology presents novel capabilities by which to record evidence of securities ownership and transactions, the trading of tokenized securities can, and it must occur largely as Congress prescribed when it enacted and subsequently amended the Act,” the company said, adding: “Such trading must occur in regulated markets, namely national securities exchanges, alternative trading systems, and at FINRA [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] regulated broker-dealers.” Nasdaq also advocated for tokenized securities to be traded “within the context of an interconnected national market system.” Concerns about Europe In addition to pushing regulators to bring tokenization under the purview of established market players, Nasdaq expressed concerns about the growing number of offerings providing exposure to US tokenized stocks in Europe. “A few trading platforms are purporting to offer investors access to tokenized US ‘equities,’ but they are not providing investors with actual shares in US companies,” Nasdaq wrote, adding: “Instead they are providing investors with digitally tradable rights to traditional digital shares that the platforms themselves purchase and hold in their own accounts. These digital rights do not comprise the full extent of the rights to which owners of traditional digital shares are entitled, including voting rights […]” Nasdaq’s proposal came amid a growing trend for real-world assets (RWAs) globally, with many platforms choosing to list tokenized versions of US investment products like Tesla shares or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for users in jurisdictions like Europe.

The company said Monday that it raised the largest Solana ( SOL ) treasury to date, led by crypto-native companies Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital. Other participants included C/M Capital Partners, which is one of Forward Industries’ existing shareholders. This follows a Bloomberg report in late August saying the three crypto giants were planning to raise $1 billion and take over a publicly-traded company to create the biggest crypto treasury dedicated to Solana. According to the announcement, Forward plans to position itself as a publicly traded institutional vehicle. It plans to generate onchain returns and long-term value by participating in the Solana ecosystem. Galaxy, Jump and Multicoin to support the Forward Industries Forward said Galaxy Digital will provide treasury management, trading, lending and staking services. Jump Crypto will support infrastructure through projects such as Firedancer and DoubleZero, while Multicoin Capital will offer strategic guidance and governance.

Ripple is done fighting the SEC, meaning it can focus on its original goal: challenging SWIFT, the world’s money transfer system. Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ripple has finally finished its legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, bringing legal clarity to the underlying coin, XRP ( XRP ). Now observers are asking whether XRP can finally focus on providing a viable alternative to SWIFT. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has been the backbone of international money transfers since its founding in 1973. However, for several years, critics have said that the system is outdated. Many in the blockchain industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, argue that blockchain technology provides higher throughput and better transparency, making it a superior alternative to SWIFT. Now that Ripple’s legal battles have calmed down, can it provide a reasonable alternative to SWIFT? How does Ripple stack up to SWIFT? Over 50 years ago, SWIFT replaced Telex as the coding system underpinning worldwide financial transactions. The system does not send money itself but rather provides standardized codes and a secure messaging platform through which banks can coordinate money transfers. A customer will make a money transfer request. Their bank will then send the request to the recipient bank, and that request may go through several other banks in the network. Actual settlement happens through established banking relationships and clearing systems. SWIFT processes over 53 million messages daily across 40,000 payment routes, 220 countries and over 11,500 institutions. But there are some major complaints with SWIFT. Transactions can take several days and are rife with fees. Furthermore, the complex network of bank partners means it is more difficult to ensure visibility. There are also delays and failures. SWIFT said in January 2024 that one in 10 transactions fails, while one in 20 settles late. The network has undergone a number of upgrades since its inception, including ISO 20022, which aims to provide clearer payment data and more transparency by Nov. 25, 2025. Still, critics claim it is ultimately outdated “legacy” tech running on decades-old XML technology. SWIFT may have the advantage of ubiquity and clear institutional adoption, but Ripple offers a clear advantage in technological terms, with faster transaction and settlement speeds, as well as lower costs. In 2018, just a couple of years before Ripple’s years-long legal battle with the SEC would begin, Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, “What we’re doing and executing on a day-by-day basis is, in fact, taking over SWIFT” as banks and remittance companies signed on to use XRP Ledger. So, with institutional partners signing on and the XRP price on a tear over the last year, what’s stopping Ripple’s ledger from challenging SWIFT? XRP’s price increased 400% over the year. Source: CoinMarketCap So, why hasn’t Ripple overtaken SWIFT? Cassie Craddock, managing director for UK and Europe at Ripple, told Cointelegraph, “We don’t see blockchain as an opportunity to replace legacy rails, rather a way of augmenting and modernizing the existing financial infrastructure, creating opportunities for greater efficiency and interoperability.” Still, “scaling to the level of traditional providers requires tackling two key hurdles: usability and regulation.” Regarding regulation, Ripple was, until recently, part of a particularly high-profile court case. In December 2020, the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton sued Ripple Labs for failing to register XRP tokens as securities under US law. The commission alleged that the company and its executives raised capital through unregistered securities sales. What followed was an expensive, years-long court battle. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not require securities registration , but that its XPR sales to institutional investors did. The court didn’t issue its final $125-million civil penalty to Ripple until August 2024. Related: Ripple vs. SEC: How the lawsuit strengthened XRP’s narrative By October, Ripple and the SEC had filed respective appeals, but following the election of US President Donald Trump and the realignment of the SEC’s priorities for crypto, both parties finally agreed to drop their case in early August 2025 . The case may have hampered XRP adoption in the US, but during the case, it signed partnerships with institutions in numerous other jurisdictions around the globe. Furthermore, the case gives XRP specifically unique legal clarity — something few cryptocurrencies can boast. However, legal clarity may not be enough for Ripple to overtake the world’s largest payments network, as banks themselves must be convinced to change how they operate. Pseudonymous software engineer and blockchain proponent Vincent Van Code said that platforms using SWIFT “process billions daily, but they are rigid, costly, and deeply siloed. A core replacement can take 5–7 years and hundreds of millions of dollars—an enormous operational risk.” They said that banks don’t change their systems because “every bank already ‘speaks SWIFT,’ making it the safest, cheapest option. Even initiatives like SWIFT GPI are just patches on a nearly 50-year-old foundation.” Van Code concluded that Ripple has to contend with fragile legacy cores and “uneven” global regulation and assuage risk-averse banks — all while countering perceptions about its underlying token’s liquidity. “SWIFT’s ubiquity is its moat, and breaking that network effect will take time.” Craddock said that “institutions need tools that feel familiar,” and that new regulations, particularly the GENIUS Act, are a “step toward clear rules that give institutions confidence to adopt blockchain in a compliant way.” “Stablecoins like Ripple USD are helping bridge this gap — they’re simple to understand, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and behave like cash in digital form. That familiarity is why we’re seeing traditional financial players increasingly comfortable using crypto and blockchain tech today.” Private payments gain ground It’s unclear whether Ripple can take on SWIFT in the future, overcoming the entrenched business practices of the banking sector and less-than-enthusiastic regulators. However, crypto is ascendant in the US, where lawmakers are making carveouts for digital assets to fulfill critical roles in the traditional finance system. Congress has clearly expressed its preference for the proliferation of private stablecoins over a digital dollar or central bank digital currency (CBDC). Congress has not outright banned a CBDC, but it has created a law whereby only the legislature can create one , excluding the Federal Reserve or commercial entities. At the same time, it passed the GENIUS Act, which gives clear rules for stablecoin issuers. In March, after the SEC dropped its investigation into Ripple, Garlinghouse told Fox News that “the market opportunity is massive” in the US and said that there’s an opportunity to modernize the payment systems from SWIFT. “The Trump effect is profound [...] you’re gonna see that in the adoption of these [blockchain] technologies.” Magazine: ChatGPT’s links to murder, suicide and ‘accidental jailbreaks’: AI Eye # Ripple # Payments # SWIFT # Adoption # XRP # Features Add reaction","Aaron Wood Sep 09, 2025 Ripple’s SEC battle is over: Time to challenge SWIFT?

In a Friday notice, Trump Media said it would buy the tokens at a price of approximately $0.153 each, bringing the total initial purchase to nearly $105 million. The transaction will be carried out as an equal exchange of stock and cash between the companies. The announcement followed Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, a joint venture established by Trump Media, Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition, to establish a $6.4 billion crypto treasury of the CRO token. According to the company, the agreement will allow Truth Social users to potentially acquire CRO on the platform as part of a rewards program. The Trump Media shares and the CRO tokens exchanged in the deal will be “subject to a lockup period,” though the company did not specify for how long that might be. The deal represented a deepening of ties between the crypto industry and the Trump administration, under scrutiny from many lawmakers for potential conflicts of interest with his digital asset ventures.

However, the agencies clarified: “Further expanding trading hours could better align US markets with the evolving reality of a global, always-on economy. Expanding trading hours may be more viable in some asset classes than others, so there may not be a one-size-fits-all approach for all products.” The potential pivot to “always-on” financial markets would increase capital velocity but also increase risk for traders, exposing their overnight and long-term positions to market participants in different time zones, who could knock them out of trades while they sleep.

Fang noted rising interest in Bitcoin treasuries from institutions in the US and EU, while efforts in Asia have remained fragmented. “This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage,” he said. The announcement said the treasury fund will become a pool of institutional capital designed to support existing firms and fuel the creation of similar treasuries around the globe. The company also said it will reinforce support for Asia’s early Bitcoin treasury pioneers while expanding outward. It added that it would create synergies between local and international treasuries to strengthen Bitcoin’s role as a reserve across markets.

The SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigated how nearly a year’s worth of text messages from Gary Gensler were permanently lost between October 2022 and September 2023, during the height of the agency’s crypto enforcement action campaign. In a report released on Wednesday, the OIG revealed that the SEC’s IT department “implemented a poorly understood and automated policy that caused an enterprise wipe of Gensler’s government-issued mobile device,” which deleted stored text messages and operating system logs. The loss was worsened by poor change management, lack of proper backups, ignored system alerts and unaddressed vendor software flaws. The IT department failed to collect or maintain necessary log data, which is why the commission could not determine why Gensler’s smartphone stopped communicating with the SEC’s mobile device management system.

Several global investment banking and financial institutions were charged with violating record-keeping and books-and-records laws under the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act. “Finance, ultimately, depends on trust. By failing to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-records obligations, the market participants we have charged today have failed to maintain that trust,” said Gensler at the time. Undermining transparency in crypto decisions The SEC has since disabled text messaging on most devices, notified the National Archives and Records Administration of lost records, introduced Capstone-specific records training for senior officials, and started improving backup practices for senior officials’ devices. “The loss of Gensler’s text messages may impact the SEC’s response to certain Freedom of Information Act requests,” it stated. Gensler, who stepped down in January, was infamous in the crypto community for his bait-and-switch offer to “come in and get registered,” which pre-empted multiple SEC actions against companies that claimed they tried to do exactly that. Enforcement actions against crypto companies reached a 10-year high in 2023. “Think about everything that happened in crypto during this time.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins has released a regulatory agenda containing proposed rules that could significantly affect how the agency handles digital assets. In a Thursday notice, the SEC released about 20 proposed rules as part of its spring 2025 agenda. Though each proposal varies in terms of the potential impact on the crypto industry, many suggested that the commission would continue to soften its enforcement approach, establishing safe harbors and restructuring existing regulations to benefit projects. “The agenda covers potential rule proposals related to the offer and sale of crypto assets to help clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets and provide greater certainty to the market,” said Atkins, adding: “[...] the agenda reflects our withdrawal of a host of items from the last Administration that do not align with the goal that regulation should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority.” Related: US SEC’s crypto task force urged to quantum-proof digital assets What’s in the SEC’s agenda? Among the proposed rules in the SEC agenda was including “certain exemptions and safe harbors” related to the offer and sale of crypto assets, and amending the Exchange Act “to account for the trading of crypto assets on [alternative trading systems] and national securities exchanges.” The modifications could allow crypto companies to operate with less regulatory oversight and reduce the risk of legal action. Other proposals suggested modifying “broker-dealer financial responsibility rules,” which could lessen the burden on crypto companies reporting data. Broker-dealer rules have been a point of contention for many in the crypto industry by placing Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations on networks, often without the means to gather such data. Notable, however, were the proposed rule changes suggesting “modernizing” the SEC’s framework to accommodate cryptocurrencies. The commission proposed the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which lays out regulations on custody, be “improved” to address crypto — less than eight months after a proposed rule change suggested bringing digital assets under stricter guidelines was quashed. Though proposed as part of Atkins’ and the SEC’s agenda, the rules must go through an extensive process before adoption, including a public comment period and review. Since the resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20, many of the commission’s decisions represented a complete about-face: dropping years-long investigations and lawsuits and issuing statements suggesting it would change its approach to enforcement. As SEC chair, Atkins has some authority to interpret commission rules and guidelines over crypto.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Tokenized assets are emerging as a blockchain-based trust layer for institutional investors targeting sustainable market opportunities, signaling a potential influx of capital onto blockchain rails. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization refers to financial and tangible assets minted on a permanent blockchain ledger, offering benefits such as fractional ownership, wider investor access and 24/7 liquidity. According to Corey Billington, co-founder and CEO of tokenization infrastructure firm Blubird, tokenized RWAs offer a tamper-proof trust system that is absent in traditional finance and climate finance. “The old system is very slow, very broken, and unfortunately, that’s where most of the market looks at the moment,” said Billington, speaking during Cointelegraph’s Chain Reaction daily live X spaces show on Monday, adding: “A [tokenized NFT] is their receipt, and that cannot be doctored. It can't be forged. Nothing can be done about that.” This “creates a whole other trust layer that just does not exist at the moment,” said the CEO, adding that this may attract more institutional capital onchain.

One major bottleneck is the slow verification process for carbon assets, which can take up to 18 months through nonprofit standard-setter Verra, developer of the widely used Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). Still, tokenized RWAs are already enabling billions of dollars to flow into ESG-aligned initiatives. Blubird has more than $18 billion in tokenization deals lined up through 2026, representing another 230 million tons of potential CO₂ emissions avoided, according to Billington. “We’re looking at roughly 230 million tons of CO₂ prevented emissions equivalent to that additional $18 billion pipeline,” said Billington. If pipelines like Blubird’s materialize, tokenization could become the backbone of institutional ESG investment strategies by 2030.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Trading company and market maker Wintermute asked the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to confirm that network tokens should not be classified as securities. In formal feedback to the agency’s request for comment, the company said clear guidance on the security status of tokens is necessary to avoid the misapplication of securities laws and ensure the continued growth of crypto markets. Wintermute said that “network tokens,” which are “intrinsically connected to the functioning of a decentralized network or protocol,” are necessary technical inputs for blockchain networks. Because of this, the company said, they fundamentally differ from financial products or securities. The company mentioned Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) as examples of network tokens that should not be classified as securities. Source: Wintermute Wintermute likens network tokens to commodities If network tokens were classified as securities, every trade of such digital assets in the US might require regulatory compliance with securities laws. This could affect the liquidity of the tokens, raise costs for traders and ultimately push activities offshore. “Such misclassification risks stifling innovation and driving blockchain development and trading activity outside of US markets,” Wintermute wrote. The company said network tokens do not meet the criteria for securities even if they are later traded for profit or used in fundraising rounds. Wintermute said network tokens function more like commodities, collectibles and real estate. These can all be bought for investment purposes without being treated as securities. Apart from its recommendations, the company also welcomed SEC guidance excluding stablecoins, memecoins and staking activities from the securities classification. It stressed that the same level of clarity should be extended to network tokens. “Clear guidance across these areas will keep US markets competitive, encourage continued dialogue with regulators, and create optimal conditions for adoption and innovation to thrive,” the company said. Cointelegraph reached out to Wintermute for more information, but did not receive a response before publication.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) presented a proposal that would significantly tighten crypto regulation. A Tuesday FSA report recommends regulating cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), moving them from under the Payment Services Act. This aims to strengthen investor protection and align crypto oversight with securities regulation. The regulator said that many issues within crypto resemble those traditionally addressed under the FIEA, so it may be appropriate to apply similar mechanisms and enforcement. Key problems in crypto investment highlighted in the report include unclear white papers, inaccurate disclosures, unregistered operations, investment scams, low risk tolerances and security concerns within exchanges. A rough translation of the report said: “So it may be appropriate to address them (crypto assets) using the mechanisms and enforcement of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.” The report is not legally binding; it is an internal briefing document prepared by the FSA secretariat to present ideas to the Financial System Council. The council is a formal advisory body to Japan’s Financial Services minister, and the government will then decide whether new rules are needed.

This is almost equivalent to one crypto exchange account for every 10 people. Still, it highlighted that small-scale trading is dominant in Japan, with more than 80% of individual accounts holding less than $675. The FSA also noted that 7.3% of those with investment experience hold crypto, more than those trading FX or holding corporate bonds. About 70% of Japanese crypto holders are middle-income earners, and 86% of users trade with the expectation of long-term price increases. The FSA’s report follows Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato’s recent recognition that cryptocurrencies deserve a place in diversified investment portfolios . “While crypto assets carry the risk of high volatility, by establishing a proper investment environment, they can become an option for diversified investment,” he said in late August. Related: Japan wrote the first stablecoin rulebook — so why is the US pulling ahead? Tighter rules for crypto Under the FIEA, crypto is already treated as a financial instrument when used as an underlying asset for derivatives. Applying the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act in totality would impose disclosure requirements on crypto issuers of securities regarding public offerings and secondary distributions. This, the FSA said, would “eliminate the information asymmetry between issuers and investors.” FIEA rules would also regulate intermediation and brokerages for buying and selling. They would also enforce rules against unfair trading and provide enforcement measures, including emergency injunctions against unregistered businesses.

Etherealize said on Wednesday that the crypto-focused venture firms Electric Capital and Paradigm led the round, which it would use to “continue driving institutional adoption of Ethereum.” The company launched in January with funding from the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to educate institutions on the blockchain and the Ether ( ETH ) token. Wall Street has yet to embrace ETH as deeply as it has Bitcoin ( BTC ) when comparing the trading volumes and inflows to related exchange-traded funds.

Etherealize to use funds for institutional tools Etherealize said the $40 million would be put toward developing crypto-based financial tools aimed at institutions.

The Ether Machine, a so-called crypto treasury company that is planning to go public soon, made the week’s largest addition with a 150,000 ETH raise on Tuesday, valued at $654 million.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED XRP tokenholders were a tipping element that helped secure Ripple Labs’ win against the US securities regulator, which ultimately ended last month when both sides agreed to drop appeals. The SEC sued Ripple in 2020, accusing it of selling the XRP ( XRP ) token as an unregistered security. Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that only some tokens could be considered securities; the case finally ended in August this year. Now the dust has settled, crypto advocate and lawyer John Deaton said , “no credible person can argue” that the “XRP Army” didn’t make a difference. “If they do they’re either ignorant to the facts and truth or intentionally lying. We have conclusive evidence that we made a difference,” he wrote on X. Source: John Deaton Deaton is known for his advocacy for crypto investors , especially XRP holders, who he argued were not being represented in the SEC’s case against Ripple. Ripple exec says XRP Army’s legwork invaluable Deborah McCrimmon, Ripple’s vice president and deputy general counsel, told The Penta Podcast in an episode on Monday that Deaton’s efforts and the XRP army gave the court visibility that the case “impacts a lot of people,” not just Ripple. However, the work they put into the case, free of charge, also proved to be a game changer in the firms attempts to prove its key arguments. Source: Digital Asset Investor Specifically, McCrimmon said Ripple was using the fair notice defense that the SEC didn’t give fair notice of the law, and how it had been enforced in the past. “And so to support that, we were looking for speeches, talks, things the SEC or the government had said related to blockchain, crypto, XRP, Ripple, and the XRP Army mined that for us,” she said. “We didn't ask them to, but once they saw this defense in our in our answer, people started finding this. I could have paid lawyers thousands of dollars, literally thousands of dollars, to do that and yet they were finding it and posting it on Twitter, and that was tremendously helpful for me.” Judge cites affidavits in her decision Deaton said there were over 2,000 exhibits filed in the court case, and in her final decision, Judge Torres cited his amicus brief and XRP holder affidavits. “She ruled XRP itself is NOT a security while citing XRP Holder Affidavits. Had she not cited those things, people could legitimately debate whether our efforts made a real difference,” Deaton said. “But the proof is in the decision itself. Often, people say one person can’t make a difference. I say: one person can inspire many people and together, they can make a difference.” Deaton rallied XRP holders to submit affidavits and make testimonies in Ripple’s case, and over the years, the XRP Army lobbied, petitioned and coordinated social media campaigns to pressure regulators. Token has mixed results after case ends Judge Torres delivered a mixed ruling in July 2023, finding that tokens sold on public exchanges did not meet the definition of a security, but the tokens sold to institutional investors were sold as unregistered securities.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), is calling for policymakers to address gaps in stablecoin regulation, particularly for those issued beyond the “robust” Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework in the European Union. In prepared remarks for the ninth annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board on Wednesday, Lagarde ​​ said EU lawmakers should take steps in situations where an entity covered under MiCA and a non-EU entity jointly issue stablecoins. She added that such stablecoin issuers should not be allowed to operate in the EU unless there were “robust equivalence regimes” at the source, which included allowing EU investors “to always redeem their holdings at par value” and requiring issuers to fully back their coins. “In the event of a run, investors would naturally prefer to redeem in the jurisdiction with the strongest safeguards, which is likely to be the EU, where MiCAR also prohibits redemption fees,” said Lagarde. “But the reserves held in the EU may not be sufficient to meet such concentrated demand.” A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging it to an asset like the US dollar or the euro. ECB policymakers have explored the potential rollout of a digital euro for years, but could be pressured by stablecoin laws and regulations pushed by the Trump administration in the US. The US Congress passed a law in July establishing a framework for stablecoins, likely benefiting issuers of US-pegged coins.

Cook said she would not step down and filed a lawsuit to block Trump’s actions. About 600 economists penned an open letter on Tuesday, reminding the administration that “no Governor should be removed absent a clear, documented ‘for cause’ basis that would withstand judicial scrutiny,” warning of challenges to the Fed’s independence. “Weakening that standard increases monetary policy uncertainty and forces markets to price political risk into interest rates, raising those rates and costs for families and businesses,” said the letter. “Elected officials should refrain from rhetoric or actions that erode the Federal Reserve’s independence […].” Cointelegraph reached out to the Fed for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. Though Cook’s case is still moving through US courts, many legal experts have already weighed in on the matter since Trump repeatedly signaled his wish to remove Powell before his term expires in 2026.

In June, the Verkhovna Rada introduced a bill to establish a crypto asset reserve, and in August, Cointelegraph learned that a taxation bill would receive its first reading. Ukraine ranks eighth globally in Chainalysis’s 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. The country scores particularly high in centralized value received across both retail and institutional categories. Also, it holds a top spot in DeFi value received — a sector gaining traction in Eastern Europe . “A window of opportunity has opened for attracting crypto investments and repatriating foreign assets of Ukrainian crypto enthusiasts,” Volodymyr Nosov, CEO of European crypto exchange WhiteBIT, told Cointelegraph. “This is a key factor for revitalizing the economy and modernizing the market [...].” Crypto tax discussions around the world More countries are weighing tax policies for cryptocurrencies as the asset class gains global acceptance. Over the past year, Denmark, Brazil and the United States have each moved to address crypto taxation. In October 2024, Denmark’s Tax Law Council recommended a bill to levy taxes on unrealized crypto gains . In his report, the Danish tax minister said that the bill’s approach would be a simpler way to tax crypto. It is still considered a proposal. In June 2025, Brazil moved to end a crypto tax exemption and impose a 17.5% flat tax rate on crypto gains amid the government’s push to raise money through taxation of financial markets. In July, representatives in the US’s lower legislative chamber were set to hold a hearing on a framework for the taxation of crypto assets in the country.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it will not pursue enforcement against two entities tied to prediction platform Polymarket. In a Wednesday notice, the CFTC said it had issued a no-action letter “regarding swap data reporting and recordkeeping regulations for event contracts” with QCX LLC and QC Clearing LLC. “The divisions will not recommend the CFTC initiate an enforcement action against either entity or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions and variable payout contract transactions […],” said the regulator. The action essentially allows Polymarket to offer event contracts without reporting the data required under US financial regulations, providing temporary relief from enforcement while not exempting the companies from regulatory compliance. In a Wednesday X post, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said the CFTC’s action had given the company “the green light to go live in the USA.” “This process has been accomplished in record timing,” said Coplan. “Stay tuned.” Related: Polymarket set for $200M raise at $1B valuation: Reports Polymarket reported acquiring QCEX in July for $112 million, which included the CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, giving it a greater foothold in US markets. According to the request for no-action relief in July, QCX said the event contracts at issue are still “required to be fully collateralized” and “no market participant will clear QCEX Contracts through a third-party clearing member.” Regulators change their tune The no-action letter seemed to be another example of US financial regulators softening their approach to crypto enforcement following the changeover to the Trump administration in January. In the last eight months, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped several investigations and lawsuits into digital asset companies, many of which were filed under former chair Gary Gensler. Donald Trump Jr., the US president’s son, joined Polymarket’s advisory board in August. Brian Quintenz, Trump’s pick to chair the CFTC, awaits consideration in the Senate, with acting chair Caroline Pham the sole commissioner remaining at the regulator as of Wednesday. Polymarket was also a target of regulatory enforcement.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Mega Matrix, a publicly traded holding company that has shifted into digital assets, filed a $2 billion shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to fund a stablecoin-focused treasury strategy, underscoring how more firms are experimenting with digital asset reserves. The funding is aimed at the Ethena stablecoin ecosystem, with proceeds directed toward accumulating the protocol’s ENA ( ENA ) governance token. Mega Matrix said the move is designed to give the company exposure to revenue generated by Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin, USDe, while also securing influence over the protocol’s governance. In SEC terms, a shelf registration is a regulatory filing that lets a company register securities for future issuance, allowing it to sell portions of its stock over time rather than all at once. In its announcement, the company emphasized that the strategy is focused “exclusively on ENA, concentrating influence and yield in a single digital asset.” Rather than holding USDe directly, Mega Matrix plans to build a significant position in ENA, which could benefit from Ethena’s “fee-switch” mechanism — an onchain feature that, once activated, distributes a share of protocol revenues to ENA holders. The company pointed to the rapid growth of Circle , a leading stablecoin issuer, and the rise of digital asset treasury strategies as drivers of its Ethena-focused plan. It also cited the US GENIUS Act, which prohibits issuers from paying yield directly to stablecoin holders. Ironically, the restriction has fueled demand for synthetic, yield-bearing alternatives such as Ethena’s USDe. “Precisely because the GENIUS act banned issuers from providing yield directly to holders, investors are turning to yield-bearing stablecoins or staked stablecoins to get yield,” CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, told Cointelegraph. Ethena’s model differs from traditional fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC ( USDC ) or USDt ( USDT ). USDe is a synthetic stablecoin designed to maintain its dollar peg using a mix of collateral hedged with perpetual futures contracts. This structure allows the protocol to generate yield from funding rates in derivatives markets. Although still smaller than its collateralized rivals, Ethena’s growth has been striking. In August, developer Ethena Labs reported that the protocol’s cumulative gross interest revenue had surpassed $500 million . Ethena USDe’s market capitalization growth.

Source: Yahoo Finance Its turn toward digital asset treasury strategies is not entirely unexpected, coming just months after the company spent $1.27 million to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) in June. Source: Cointelegraph Even so, Mega Matrix is not alone in looking to digital assets as a balance-sheet strategy. Many smaller firms have either added cryptocurrencies to their treasuries or pivoted entirely toward digital asset holdings. One recent example is ETHZilla , a former biotechnology company that has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Ether ( ETH ) through a mix of funding strategies. Other companies pursuing similar paths include BitMine Immersion Technologies , SharpLink Gaming, and Bit Digital. Despite their growth, digital asset treasury strategies carry significant risks, according to Josip Rupena, CEO of lending firm Milo. Speaking with Cointelegraph , Rupena compared the model to collateralized debt obligations — the complex financial products that played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis. “There’s this aspect where people take what is a pretty sound product, a mortgage back in the day or Bitcoin and other digital assets today, for example, and they start to engineer them, taking them down a direction where the investor is unsure about the exposure they’re getting,” he said.

During an interview with Bloomberg published on Wednesday, Novogratz said that “in the not-so-distant future, the biggest user of stablecoins is going to be AI.” He said he expects users will be able to ask an AI to buy their groceries, and have it independently engage in the necessary transactions: ”Your grocery agent, who knows what you like to eat, knows that you’re on a diet or not on a diet, is going to figure out what groceries to buy from where.” AI agents are autonomous software programs that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals without constant human intervention. The primary feature that distinguishes these systems from most current AI systems is their higher degree of independence. Novogratz highlighted that such an agent would not “send a wire instruction or a Venmo” and instead would rely on stablecoin transactions. He said that he is unaware of whether such systems will be in place in one or five years, but he expects us to “see an explosion of stablecoin transactions.” Michael Novogratz.

US Bancorp’s reentry follows a regulatory shift under President Donald Trump’s current administration, which rolled back a previous SEC rule that had forced banks to hold capital on their balance sheet for crypto-related activities, according to a Wednesday report by Bloomberg. “We had the playbook and it’s sort of opening it up and executing it again,” said Stephen Philipson, head of US Bank’s institutional division. He noted that the bank plans to scale the service as demand grows and is also exploring how digital assets might fit into other areas like wealth management and consumer payments.

Trust Wallet, the self-custodial crypto wallet owned by Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has integrated tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its platform. After initially disclosing the plan to introduce real-world assets (RWAs) in June, Trust Wallet has launched tokenized versions of US stocks and ETFs for use around the globe, the company said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on Wednesday. The integration is carried out in collaboration with Ondo Finance, a major decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on RWAs, and the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch. “Integrating RWAs into self-custodial wallets is an important step in making global finance more open and efficient,” Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen said. “The bigger picture is how blockchain democratizes access to financial markets and lays the foundation for a more inclusive future of finance,” she added. Ondo brings the assets, 1inch powers the rails As part of the collaboration, Ondo Finance will supply Trust Wallet with tokenized RWA assets — stocks, ETFs and bonds — initially issued on Ethereum using smart contracts , with Solana support planned next.

This is just the beginning — we’ll be integrating more RWA providers and liquidity sources over time, so users get the broadest, most open access possible.” According to the Trust Wallet website, RWA tokens are not available in specific regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area. “Your swap will not go through if you reside in a region where RWA tokens are not available,” Trust Wallet said.

Confluence of self-custody and RWAs By launching RWA support on its self-custodial wallet , Trust Wallet has emerged as one of the first platforms to integrate the concept of RWAs and self-custody. While self-custody enables users to manage their assets independently, free from centralized control, tokenized RWAs are digital representations of real-world properties serving as certificates of ownership. According to Trust Wallet’s Sami Waittinen, the collaboration aligns with the company’s mission of promoting freedom of ownership and providing people with direct, secure access to the full spectrum of crypto and Web3 opportunities. Trust Wallet users can swap USDC ( USDC ) into RWAs. Source: Trust Wallet “Tokenized RWAs are a natural next step as they unlock traditionally gated assets like stocks or ETFs, and make them accessible to anyone, anywhere, from their own wallet. It’s a powerful extension of what self-custody can mean,” he said. Lucien Bourdon, an analyst at the hardware wallet company Trezor, distinguished two perspectives when addressing the mix of self-custody and RWAs. “If a blockchain supports real-world asset tokens, any self-custodial hardware wallet that supports that chain can hold them securely,” Bourdon told Cointelegraph. Related: Tokenized alternative funds jump 47% to $1.7B in 30 days From the wallet’s perspective, he said there’s no difference between an RWA token and any other token, adding that some examples, like gold or Treasury-backed tokens, are already being stored this way. There is an important distinction between the two from an ownership perspective, though, he said. “With cryptocurrencies, your keys equal direct ownership of the asset. With real-world assets or stablecoins, your keys secure the token, but the underlying asset remains with an issuer or custodian,” Bourdon said, adding: “That means self-custody works technically, but trust in the issuer is still essential.” Magazine: XRP ‘cycle target’ is $20, Strategy Bitcoin lawsuit dismissed: Hodler’s Digest, Aug. 24 – 30 # Business # Wallet # Ethereum # Changpeng Zhao # Stocks # Binance # Solana # Self Custody # Trust Wallet # RWA # ETF # Tokenization # Companies Add reaction","Helen Partz Sep 03, 2025 CZ-owned Trust Wallet launches tokenized stocks and ETFs Trust Wallet’s self-custodial wallet rolled out RWA support in collaboration with Ondo Finance and 1inch, initially available on Ethereum.",CoinTelegraph,2025-09-03 13:00:42+00:00,2025-12-07 13:18:21.974056,2025-12-07T19:19:04.935467

According to a Wednesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the company used the funds to buy more than 1,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) to jumpstart its Bitcoin treasury. Treasury said it aims “to be the first Bitcoin treasury company listed on a primary European exchange.” Treasury plans to make its way onto the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange through a reverse listing by merging with lender MKB Nedsense. A reverse listing enables private companies to acquire stock exchange listings without meeting the requirements by merging with already-listed companies. Treasury founder and CEO Khing Oei told Cointelegraph that the company plans to leverage future equity issuance and convertible debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings. The announcement notes that it plans to use “both equity and debt to accumulate Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset.” European Bitcoin treasuries on the rise With an initial allocation of 1,000 BTC, Treasury was catapulted among Europe’s most notable corporate Bitcoin holders. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data , Europe’s top corporate Bitcoin treasury is the German firm Bitcoin Group, with 3,605 BTC worth about $400 million at the time of writing. It is followed by French company Sequans Communications with 3,205 BTC worth about $356 million and UK-based The Smarter Web Company with its 2,440 BTC valued at $270 million. The number of European Bitcoin treasury firms is getting increasingly crowded, with Dutch cryptocurrency service provider Amdax recently announcing that it is preparing to launch a Bitcoin treasury company on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange , like Treasury.

The agencies clarified that existing law does not prevent regulated US or foreign exchanges, such as national securities exchanges (NSEs), designated contract markets (DCMs) and foreign boards of trade (FBOTs) from listing spot crypto products, including those with leverage and margin features. The move follows the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets recommendations, which urged regulators to provide clarity and keep blockchain innovation within the United States. “Today, the Divisions provide their view that DCMs, FBOTs, and NSEs are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products. Market participants are invited to engage with SEC staff or CFTC staff, as needed.” Regulators said they are ready to review exchange filings, address questions on custody and clearing and ensure new spot markets meet standards for transparency, surveillance and investor protection.

The staff guidance is the latest sign of how US policy on digital assets has shifted under the administration of US President Donald Trump.

At an extraordinary general meeting on Monday, investors backed amendments to the company’s articles of incorporation to expand its authorized shares to 2.7 billion. It also introduced a new dual-class preferred stock system that would allow Metaplanet to attract different types of investors while preserving control for existing shareholders. Class A shares would carry a fixed dividend, offering income-focused investors more stable returns. Class B shares would be a riskier bet, but come with the option of converting into common stock.

This paved the way for the shareholder meeting, which was likely the biggest hurdle in internal governance.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED After a monthlong break, the US Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to return to conducting government business, which includes key policies affecting the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. Both chambers of the 119th session of the US Congress went on recess weeks ago as part of their schedule established in January. The move effectively paused any work toward passage of a bill to establish digital asset market structure, consider the nomination of Brian Quintenz to become chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and legislation containing a provision for restricting a central bank digital currency (CBDC). US Senate committee looking to pass market structure in September One of the first legislative items on Republicans’ agenda upon their return will be to pass a bill establishing crypto market structure out of a committee and for a floor vote. In July, Republicans in the House passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act with the support of 78 Democrats, moving the bill to the Senate for additional amendments and debate. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the most outspoken voices in Congress advocating for less restrictive and clearer crypto regulations, has been one of the lead Republicans calling for market structure. During an August blockchain conference, Lummis speculated that the Senate Banking Committee would pass its version of market structure building on the CLARITY Act by the end of September, followed by consideration in the Senate Agriculture Committee in October. The Wyoming senator predicted the bill would end up on US President Donald Trump’s desk “before the end of the year.” At time of publication, neither the Senate Agriculture Committee nor Senate Banking Committee had announced hearings to consider the bill. Looking for a new CFTC chair Starting on Wednesday, Caroline Pham, a Republican, will be the sole remaining commissioner, and acting chair of the CFTC following the departure of Kristin Johnson, a Democratic member. Johnson announced in May that she planned to resign before 2026, and Pham said she would move “to the private sector” if the Senate were to confirm Quintenz. Even with Johnson’s impending departure and the CFTC running without many in leadership positions, Quintenz’s confirmation did not appear to be a guarantee at time of publication. Before the Senate went on recess, the agriculture committee delayed a vote on the prospective chair’s nomination at the request of the White House. Related: Crypto advocacy groups double down on Quintenz confirmation at CFTC amid pushback Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both Trump supporters and donors, reportedly pressured the president to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination. Though both brothers initially supported the nomination after Trump announced it in February, they later claimed he would not fully enact the president’s crypto agenda. As of Monday, the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to consider five of Trump’s nominations on Wednesday, but the Senate Agriculture Committee had not set up a time for Quintenz. House to vote on defense bill containing CBDC ban The House managed to pass the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act in July with the slimmest of Democratic support. However, it appears that Republicans are looking for alternatives to the bill, which was sent to the Senate for consideration. In August, the House Rules Committee shared a revision to HR 3838, a bill implementing the National Defense Authorization Act. The revised legislation included a provision to ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar — one of the tenets of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. It’s unclear which bill, if any, will have enough support to pass through Congress without amendments or modifications.

The token is now trading at $4,389, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours. “Bitcoin has been going sideways for months while there is real momentum for Ethereum. We have seen the ETF flows in August heavily favouring Ethereum. In our view, this is likely to continue in the medium term.” Crypto no longer a one-horse Bitcoin race Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer of Australian crypto investment manager Merkle Tree Capital, told Cointelegraph that although long-standing Bitcoin holders are diversifying into Ether, it’s not an abandonment of the token; instead, it’s recognition that the crypto landscape has matured. “After years of holding, many OG whales view Bitcoin as digital gold while Ether offers yield via staking, and exposure to the broader smart contract economy,” he said. “For Bitcoin veterans, allocating into Ether is less about chasing hype and more about acknowledging that digital assets are no longer just about storing value, but a multi-protocol ecosystem with a diverse and growing use case set.” However, McMillin said not every OG whale is rotating out; most are keeping their Bitcoin exposure intact. It’s just this subset that’s signaling that Ether has become a core holding rather than a speculative side bet.

According to a Thursday court filing, two lead plaintiffs, Michelle Clarity and Mehmet Cihan Unlusoy, and an investor representing other shareholders, submitted the stipulation for dismissal. “The dismissal with respect to Co-Lead Plaintiffs’ claims and Anas Hamza’s claims, but not absent class members’ claims, is with prejudice,” the court document reads.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED 21Shares, a Switzerland-based asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), has listed the Hyperliquid ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The product gives investors exposure to the Hyperliquid token without the need for wallets or onchain custody. In a Friday announcement , the company described Hyperliquid as one of the major venues for decentralized derivatives, claiming it processes more than $8 billion in daily volume, with $2 trillion in trades since its 2023 launch, and roughly 80% of the total decentralized perpetuals activity. The listing, which marks the first institutional-grade product offering exposure to the Hyperliquid protocol, comes just days after Hyperliquid’s token (HYPE) hit a record high of $50.99. Mandy Chiu, the head of financial product development at 21Shares, said Hyperliquid’s “growth has been nothing short of extraordinary, and the underlying economics are among the most compelling we’ve seen in the space.” Founded in 2018, 21Shares has a track record of launching regulated crypto products, including the first physically backed crypto ETP. It offers spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, alongside a suite of crypto ETPs in Europe ranging from single-asset products like Solana ( SOL ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) to diversified baskets and staking-focused funds. Related: Hyperliquid reimburses $2M to crypto traders after API outage The rise of Hyperliquid Hyperliquid, launched in late 2022, is a layer-1 blockchain with a decentralized exchange for perpetual futures . Unlike most DeFi platforms that use automated market makers, it runs a traditional onchain order book that matches buy and sell orders directly, clearing trades in under a second without outside oracles or offchain infrastructure. Users connect via wallets to place spot or perpetual orders, which settle natively onchain. Trading fees are funneled into daily buybacks of the HYPE token, the protocol’s native asset. That model has fueled rapid growth, with Hyperliquid setting records in trading volume, revenue and user activity over the past few months. In July, the exchange processed $319 billion in trades , the highest monthly volume ever for a DeFi perpetuals platform, helping push total decentralized perp volume to nearly $487 billion, per DefiLlama . It also captured 35% of all blockchain revenue that month, a share analysts at VanEck said came at the expense of Solana, Ethereum and BNB Chain . The platform emerged as the seventh-largest derivatives exchange overall by daily activity, surpassing 600,000 registered users in July. While a 37-minute outage on July 29 temporarily sidelined traders, Hyperliquid reimbursed $2 million in losses , drawing praise from its community for the quick response. However, concerns about Hyperliquid’s market integrity emerged on Wednesday, when four large traders pocketed nearly $48 million in suspected manipulation of Plasma’s XPL token. The token briefly spiked 200% to $1.80 before smaller traders absorbed large losses. Still, optimism around the protocol’s long-term trajectory continues to build. Speaking at the WebX 2025 conference in Tokyo, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, known for his bold and sometimes controversial market calls, told an audience he expects the platform’s native token to rise 126-fold over the next three years , citing the expansion of stablecoins and the exchange’s surging fee revenue.

Takashi Tezuka, Japan’s country manager at Web3 infrastructure provider Startale Group, told Cointelegraph that the gap between Japan and the United States on stablecoins reflects a deeper philosophical difference. “The GENIUS Act was greeted with a mix of relief and curiosity,” Tezuka said, referring to the latest US stablecoin bill . “Relief, “because the US has finally caught up with what Japan did two years earlier — putting a comprehensive legal framework around stablecoins,” he added.

Crypto asset manager 21Shares filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the price of SEI, following Canary Capital’s similar application in April. The S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC on Thursday proposes utilizing crypto price index provider CF Benchmarks to track the price of SEI, using data from multiple crypto exchanges . SEI is the native token of the Sei network, which was launched in August 2023. The network itself is a layer-1 blockchain that specializes in trading infrastructure for decentralized exchanges and marketplaces. Its native token can be used to pay for network gas fees and participate in governance. In a statement to Cointelegraph, Federico Brokate, head of US Business at 21Shares, said the firm chose SEI for its ETF because it “stood out as a high-performance layer 1 designed specifically for trading applications, with growing adoption across decentralized exchanges and infrastructure.” ”We believe SEI represents an important development in the evolution of blockchain scalability and utility, and our goal is to provide investors with regulated, transparent access to this emerging asset.” Coinbase Custody Trust Company would act as the SEI custodian, while 21Shares also floated the possibility of staking SEI to generate additional returns. However, the firm said in the filing it’s still investigating whether there would be “undue legal, regulatory or tax risk.” Race for first SEI ETF There are currently no approved spot crypto ETFs in the US other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, although there are several applications for ETFs targeting other cryptocurrencies. In an X post on Thursday, 21Shares said the ETF filing was a “key milestone in our vision to expand exchange-traded access to the SEI Network.” Brokate said the S-1 filing is the first step in a longer regulatory process, with approval depending entirely on the SEC’s review. “Historically, these processes can take several months or more. Our focus is on ensuring that the structure is compliant and ready should approval be granted,” he said. ”It’s early days, and while there is no guarantee of approval, we believe this is a meaningful step in advancing the conversation around how investors can safely and transparently access a wider set of blockchain ecosystems.” Source: 21Shares US The token SEI currently trades for $0.30 after rising 4.2% in the last 24 hours. CoinGecko ranks SEI in 74th place in terms of market capitalization. Another SEI ETF has already been filed US digital asset investment firm Canary Capital also applied for an SEI ETF, in April, which would “offer institutional and retail investors direct exposure to staked SEI,” and also have “passive income via staking rewards,” according to an April 30 statement from the SEI network. Justin Barlow, executive director at the Sei Development Foundation, said in a statement following Canary Capital’s filing that ETFs are “a gateway for broader adoption, providing a vital bridge between crypto and mainstream markets.” A flood of other ETF applications waiting in the wings 21Shares already has ETFs on the market, including the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which tracks the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ), and has applied for others to track SUI ( SUI ), XRP ( XRP ) and Ondo, the token of DeFi platform Ondo Finance . Other ETF issuers such as VanEck, Bitwise, and Grayscale have submitted applications for Solana ( SOL ), while yet other issuers are pursuing products tied to XRP, Cardano ( ADA ) and even memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Related: Crypto ETPs post $1.4B losses amid recent Bitcoin, Ether sell-offs In an effort to streamline approvals, the SEC is reportedly exploring a simplified listing structure that would automate a significant portion of the process, according to crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett . Terrett said under the new system, issuers would submit the standard SEC form S-1 and wait for 75 days. If the SEC doesn’t post a formal objection, the ETF would be automatically approved for listing, possibly reducing the back-and-forth communication between fund managers and the regulator.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to bring crypto companies back to the country to establish leadership in digital assets. The lack of clear regulations caused an exodus of crypto companies from the US between 2021 and 2024, and led to a majority of crypto trading volume occurring on offshore exchanges . Edwin Mata, an attorney and CEO of tokenization platform Brickken, told Cointelegraph that ambiguous regulations have fragmented the policy landscape in the US. The attorney told Cointelegraph that clear rules of the road would reduce the legal burden on crypto companies, allowing them to do business in the US without fear of legal reprisal and regulation by enforcement. The CFTC is accepting public feedback for its crypto policies to craft regulations that will protect financial market participants without creating an undue burden that drives innovative projects offshore.

A Securities and Exchange Commission filing from the second quarter of this year shows that Caliber had a stockholders’ equity deficit of $17.6 million.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Trump administration is considering at least 11 candidates to replace Jerome Powell when his term as Federal Reserve chair expires in May. At least three of them have taken positive stances toward crypto. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Wednesday that there are 11 “very strong candidates” for Fed chair, which he’ll begin to vet and shortlist starting next month. The list of candidates, as CNBC reported on Aug. 13, citing two administration officials, includes Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Fed Governor Chris Waller, Fed Vice Supervision Chair Michelle Bowman and former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey. The list also includes Bush administration economic adviser Marc Sumerlin, investment bank Jefferies chief market strategist David Zervos and BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder. The Federal Reserve sets US interest rates, which affect how the market invests. Lower interest rates increase liquidity and usually spur bets on volatile, risky assets like crypto, while interest rate hikes typically see investors sell riskier bets. Rieder once said Bitcoin is “here to stay” BlackRock’s Rieder has made positive comments about crypto in the past. He told The Wall Street Journal in early 2024 that Bitcoin could likely “be a big part of the asset allocation framework” and that “over time people become more and more comfortable with it.” Related: Bitcoin won’t be ‘priced in’ until Trump announces new Fed chair Rieder told CNBC in November 2020 that he thought crypto and Bitcoin were “here to stay” and that “the receptivity — particularly millennials’ receptivity — of technology and cryptocurrency is real.” BlackRock has the largest Bitcoin and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds on the market. Feds Waller, Bowman make crypto-friendly moves The Fed’s Waller and Bowman, reportedly also in the running, have both recently signalled a friendly approach to crypto. Bowman, the Fed’s top regulatory official, said on Aug. 20 that the central bank’s staff should be allowed to invest a small amount in crypto to help them understand the technology, adding it would help with a “working understanding of the underlying functionality.” Fed Governor Waller said a day later that the banking sector had “nothing to be afraid of” about crypto payments operating outside the traditional banking system, as it was “simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions.” In comparison, Powell has addressed crypto a handful of times and has usually urged a cautious approach. He said in June that crypto had become more mainstream and expected banks to increase engagement with the sector. In December, he said Bitcoin was more of a competitor for gold than it was the US dollar. Honorable mention: Jefferies works with crypto Meanwhile, Jefferies, the investment bank for which Zervos directs strategy, is involved in crypto-tied entities. The bank has backed the recent public debuts of trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, crypto exchange Bullish and crypto-based lender Figure Technology Solutions. It also bet early on the Bitcoin ( BTC ) buying ambitions of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and has reportedly had a senior banker dedicated exclusively to crypto for at least five years. Powell’s tenure as chair ends in May, but his 14-year term on the Fed board ends in early 2028. His highly anticipated speech on Friday raised hopes of an interest rate cut, with financial markets now expecting the Fed to cut rates when it again meets in mid-September.

The filing comes as asset managers step up their push into crypto ETFs and yield-generating strategies. According to the filing, the REX-Osprey BNB + Staking ETF would allocate at least 80% of its capital to BNB ( BNB ), the native token of the Binance ecosystem, or gain exposure to the asset through a Cayman Islands subsidiary. The remaining assets could be invested in other ETFs or exchange-traded products offering additional BNB exposure. BNB staked on the BNB Chain, which uses a proof-of-staked-authority consensus, is estimated to generate annual yields of 1.5% to 3% for the network’s validators.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Digital asset lender Ledn has tapped Swiss crypto bank Sygnum to refinance its $50 million Bitcoin-backed loan, in a deal that the companies say opens the door to tokenized, Bitcoin-collateralized investment opportunities. While the refinancing matches Ledn’s $50 million syndicated loan from 2024, the latest facility was twice oversubscribed, the companies said Wednesday. An oversubscribed loan offering indicates that investor demand exceeds the available loan allocation, often signaling strong institutional interest. In such cases, investors may receive only a fraction of their requested allocation, or the issuer may increase the loan size to accommodate more capital. A portion of the loan was tokenized via Sygnum’s Desygnate platform, which allows private credit deals to be issued as onchain investment products. By leveraging tokenization , the facility can be distributed more broadly to qualified investors. Source: Sygnum Bank The companies said the oversubscription highlights growing investor demand for inflation-resistant income products, especially as yields in both traditional markets and DeFi continue to flatten. Earlier this year, DeFi analytics company Neutrl reported evidence of flattening yields, noting that stablecoin APRs had dropped below 6% — a far cry from the double-digit returns investors enjoyed during the previous market cycle before the 2022 bear market . Ledn isn’t alone in the Bitcoin lending space. In January, Coinbase reintroduced Bitcoin-backed loans for US customers, with Morpho Labs facilitating the lending process. In July, Cointelegraph reported that the Cantor Fitzgerald–backed Twenty One Capital was exploring US dollar loans secured by Bitcoin collateral .

According to a Wednesday filing , the company plans to issue up to 555 million new shares, which could increase its total outstanding stock from 722 million to about 1.27 billion shares. The issue price will be determined Sept. 9-11, with payments scheduled to settle shortly after. Metaplanet said the bulk of the funds will go toward acquiring additional Bitcoin ( BTC ), adding to its existing treasury reserves of 18,991 BTC (valued at around $2.1 billion). The company said the strategy is designed to protect against Japan’s weak yen, mitigate inflation risks and enhance corporate value. A further $45 million will be directed into the firm’s “Bitcoin Income Business,” which generates revenue by selling covered call options on its BTC holdings. The company said the program is already producing profit and will be expanded with the new funds.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Prediction market Polymarket has added Donald Trump Jr. to its advisory board after receiving a strategic investment from 1789 Capital, which describes itself as a politically aligned vehicle backing companies it sees advancing “American exceptionalism.” The companies did not reveal financial terms, but Axios estimated the investment at “double-digit millions of dollars."" Trump Jr. became a partner in the fund in 2024. In a Tuesday statement, he said that ""Polymarket cuts through media spin and so-called 'expert' opinion by letting people bet on what they actually believe will happen in the world."" The investment follows Polymarket's efforts to a regulated return to the US market, after being forced to block users under a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) action. In 2022, the CFTC fined the company $1.4 million for operating an unregistered swaps platform and ordered it to block American users. To re-establish a legal foothold, it acquired CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange QCEX for $112 million in July 2025, coinciding with the closure of CFTC and Department of Justice investigations into the platform. Polymarket burst onto the scene in 2020, letting users wager crypto on bets ranging from presidential elections to celebrity gossip. The platform quickly grew into one of the world’s largest prediction platforms, drawing millions in daily volume but also scrutiny from regulators. Kalshi, Polymarket’s main US competitor, has also repeatedly clashed with regulators over its push to list contracts on political outcomes, including control of Congress. The scrutiny intensified in August when US Representative Dina Titus urged the CFTC to investigate Brian Quintenz , a former commissioner nominated to chair the agency, who also sits on Kalshi’s board — raising conflict-of-interest concerns that delayed his Senate confirmation. Election betting, regulation and Polymarket’s next phase During the 2024 US presidential race, Polymarket handled more than $3.6 billion in bets, with roughly $2.7 billion staked on the Trump–Harris matchup alone. That surge of activity drew criticism from several US lawmakers. Source: Polymarket, 2024 US presidential elections In Aug. 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley and others wrote a letter to the CFTC calling for a ban on election betting . They argued that allowing people to place “extraordinary bets while simultaneously contributing to a specific candidate or party, and political insiders to bet on elections using non-public information, will further degrade public trust in the electoral process.” The sentiment has also been echoed in sports . The National Football League (NFL) recently warned that prediction markets like Polymarket pose integrity risks, arguing that without the compliance and monitoring systems required of licensed sportsbooks, such platforms could leave games vulnerable to manipulation. Despite lingering criticism, on July 21, Polymarket was reported to be finalizing a $200 million funding round valuing the platform at $1 billion. The platform also published a US rulebook in August and ran digital ads in the US that same month promoting its return.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED While the US GENIUS Act is being celebrated as a market catalyst for stablecoin adoption, Japan’s earlier reforms show the flip side: Clarity doesn’t automatically translate into immediate real-world utility. Japan had the world’s first comprehensive stablecoin regime in 2023, but adoption has been muted. Licensed issuers exist on paper, yet there’s no thriving yen-stablecoin economy. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Takashi Tezuka, country manager at Web3 infrastructure developer Startale Group, said the adoption gap between the US and Japan reflects a philosophical difference in regulatory design. “The GENIUS Act was greeted with a mix of relief and curiosity,” Tezuka said, “because the US has finally caught up with what Japan did two years earlier — putting a comprehensive legal framework around stablecoins.” Under Japan’s 2023 amendment to the Payment Services Act, only licensed banks, trust banks and registered money transfer agents are permitted to issue stablecoins. The US approach under the GENIUS Act , by contrast, opens the door more widely: Not only banks, but also federally licensed non-bank companies can pursue stablecoin issuance, provided they meet reserve and compliance standards. This underscores a philosophical divide. “Japan prizes systemic stability above innovation speed, while the US is signaling a bigger market-opening play,” Tezuka noted. Still, the gap may not last long.

Trump Media, Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition entered into a definitive agreement to jointly establish Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, according to a Tuesday announcement. The entity will be a digital asset treasury company focused on the acquisition of Cronos ( CRO ), the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos blockchain, developed by Crypto.com. Majority-owned by Trump Media, Crypto.com and Yorkville, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy aims to build a treasury of at least $6.42 billion. “Largest publicly traded CRO treasury” According to the announcement, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy will fund its digital asset treasury with $1 billion in CRO tokens, $420 million in cash and warrants, plus a $5 billion credit line from an affiliate of Yorkville. The capital would make CRO Strategy the “first and largest publicly traded CRO treasury company,” the companies said in the announcement, adding that it would potentially become the “largest digital asset treasury company to market cap ratio in history.” An excerpt from the Trump Media Group CRO Strategy announcement by Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek.

Validator node for staking rewards Following the completion of the business combination, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy plans to capture long-term value by allocating “substantially all of the company’s cash reserves” to acquire CRO. The company emphasized its focus on yield-generating assets rather than “traditional non-productive holdings.” The strategy includes the establishment of operation of a validator node, or a specialized participant in the Cronos’ proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network , along with the delegation of CRO under management to the validator. Related: Dollar stability questioned as Trump ousts Federal Reserve governor By operating a validator node, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy wants to enable direct participation in the network’s security and governance as well as generate staking rewards to reinvest to compound CRO holdings and offset operational costs. “ The validator will be established and maintained by a crypto-native team with a deep understanding of the Cronos ecosystem, aiming to maximize staking rewards and attracting additional delegation of CRO from third-party CRO holders,” the company said. Why Cronos? Launched as a mainnet beta in November 2021 , Cronos was built by the founders of Crypto.com and was initially launched as the Crypto.com Coin (CRO).

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Aug. 26, 2025, 2 PM UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan. US President Donald Trump announced the dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, raising questions about the reliability of the US dollar. In a Tuesday post , the White House Rapid Response X profile published a letter signed by Trump removing Cook from her role at the Federal Reserve. He accused her of having made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements and, addressing her directly, wrote: “I have determined that faithfully executing the law requires your immediate removal from office.“ According to a Tuesday Associated Press report , Cook said she would not step down. She said Trump was attempting to remove her from her post “for cause,” but claimed that “no cause exists under the law,” and added that Trump “has no authority” to remove her. She concluded that she “will not resign.” Crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan said that signing two inconsistent personal mortgage documents — which is what Cook is accused of — does not constitute a valid cause for firing. He explained that “cause generally means some misconduct, neglect of duty, dishonesty, or action that materially impairs the individual’s ability to perform their obligations.” Brogan said that “it is certain that a court will grant” a preliminary injunction, which will prevent Cook from being removed from her position until the case concludes. He explained: “If the courts deny the President the power to remove Governor Cook, the effect will be to leave her in her seat until the end of her term.” Related: Rising Fed rate chatter may be a red flag for crypto: Santiment The Fed’s independence is critical The Federal Reserve has a significant degree of independence from the US government. Founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich, told Cointelegraph that the Fed’s independence “is the foundation for the stability of the US economy.” He explained: “It ensures objective monetary policy, like rates, inflation without politics, maintaining investor confidence and preventing crises. Without it, there is a risk of manipulation and economic instability, as in authoritarian countries.“ Brogan similarly said that “if Fed independence is undermined, it will negatively affect US monetary policy and probably weaken the dollar further.” He explained why central bank independence is in place: “The basis for central bank independence is the sense that regulators who are accountable to the public will be susceptible to short-term thinking, which will ultimately be harmful.” Obchakevich suggested that Trump decided to fire Cook for “political reasons” and that his decision undermined the Fed’s independence. This leads toward market uncertainty and worsens economic sentiment, he said, adding: “This causes volatility, a weakening of the dollar and a threat to its reserve role with the risk of recession.“ When asked whether Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be a potential solution, Obchakevich said that in the long term, “Bitcoin could weaken the dollar's role as a reserve currency.” Still, he said Bitcoin did not appear to be a near-term solution. Related: US Fed to end oversight program for banks’ crypto activities Trump’s clashes with the Federal Reserve The news followed repeated clashes between Trump and the Federal Reserve’s leadership. In mid-April, Trump bashed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for allegedly cutting interest rates too slowly amid a US-initiated trade war. He then went so far as to suggest firing him. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said. Market participants were quick to reject the idea. Famed crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said that Trump shouldn’t follow through on his threat to fire Powell . “I do not believe that the president of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed” chair, he said. He suggested the action would set a bad precedent. US Senator Elizabeth Warren also warned that if Trump fired Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash.

The agenda was to discuss the tokenized trading system, the regulatory framework and legal requirements for operating the system and the potential benefits of tokenization. The SEC memo states that it met with Kraken on Monday. Source: The SEC . Kraken’s SEC meeting came at a time when traditional exchange industry associations and global regulators have urged the SEC to take a stricter regulatory approach toward tokenized stocks. The associations have argued that there is a lack of investor protection safeguards that are present in the traditional markets. Tokenized stocks are typically not bound by the restrictions of traditional markets and can be traded 24/7. Kraken and Robinhood are the two most prominent platforms to offer these services. Kraken announced its tokenized stocks service on May 22 , which enables non-US investors to buy US equities around the clock. Robinhood started offering tokenized stocks of US equities to users in the European Union on June 30 . On Wednesday, Kraken announced that it had expanded its tokenized stock product offering to the Tron blockchain .

This represents a mere 1.35% of all Real World Assets (RWAs) that have been tokenized, as nearly $26.5 billion worth of RWAs are currently onchain.

The idea was first conceived by Michael Saylor of Strategy in 2020 and has since inspired hundreds of companies to follow suit. The model has recently gained traction in the health sector, where several small-cap and mid-cap firms have pivoted into crypto treasuries to diversify and attract investor attention.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Aug. 27 at 14:10 UTC): This article has been updated to state that the letter was sent to IOSCO and ESMA. Exchange industry associations have asked global regulators to curb the growth and adoption of tokenized stocks, arguing that these products do not represent actual equities and expose investors to significant risks. Reuters reported on Monday that the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) sent a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), urging stricter regulatory oversight of tokenized stocks. The organization argued that tokenized stocks “mimic” the equities they are designed to represent but lack the investor protections built into traditional markets. “We are alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenized US stocks,” the WFE told Reuters, without naming specific firms or platforms. “These products are marketed as stock tokens or equivalent to the stocks when they are not.” Source: Jevgenijs Kazanins WFE, headquartered in the UK, is an industry group representing exchanges and clearing houses worldwide. The call for clampdowns comes as tokenized securities gain traction on Wall Street and beyond, driven by the promise of greater efficiency, lower costs and broader market access through blockchain technology. The value of tokenized assets has already climbed past $26 billion, according to industry data. Tokenized stocks — digital representations of traditional equities issued on a blockchain — remain a small slice of that market, but their footprint is expected to grow as major platforms such as Coinbase , Kraken and Robinhood move into the space. Tokenized stocks account for a tiny fraction of the $26.5 billion tokenized securities market.

As US lawmakers mulled over the GENIUS stablecoin bill, banking groups quietly lobbied to exclude yield-bearing stablecoins — a feature that could have directly competed with their service offerings. They were ultimately successful, with GENIUS explicitly barring stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders. While the passage of GENIUS was widely seen as a win for the stablecoin industry, it also came with a trade-off. “By explicitly prohibiting stablecoin issuers from offering yield, the GENIUS Act actually protects a major advantage of money market funds,” Temujin Louie, CEO of crosschain interoperability protocol Wanchain, told Cointelegraph . Still, the SEC appears open to tokenization at the highest levels. In July, SEC Chair Paul Atkins described tokenization as an “innovation” that should be advanced within the US economy. That same month, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce stressed that tokenized securities, including tokenized equities, must nonetheless comply with existing securities laws.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ether treasury company ETHZilla, which recently pivoted from its biotechnology roots to cryptocurrency, has approved a $250 million share repurchase program — signaling that some firms may increasingly tap digital-asset gains as a source of liquidity. ETHZilla’s board of directors authorized the buyback of up to $250 million worth of its outstanding common shares, the company disclosed Monday. The company currently has 165.4 million shares outstanding. The move comes less than a month after the firm rebranded from 180 Life Sciences and made Ether ( ETH ) its core strategy — a pivot that helped revive its beaten-down stock. ETHZilla’s stock price can clearly be seen benefiting from its new ETH treasury focus.

At current market levels, those holdings are worth about $489 million. The company said its most recent ETH purchases will be staked with Electric Capital. Management’s language around the repurchase echoed classic triggers, citing “market conditions,” “management discretion,” and “alternative uses of capital.” ETHZilla’s new strategy comes against a backdrop of weak fundamentals. As a public company, it has struggled with limited revenues, persistent losses and shareholder dilution. Last year alone, it reported an accumulated deficit of over $141.5 million. ETHZilla is not alone in embracing crypto as a balance-sheet asset.

Companies that borrow heavily to accumulate crypto could face worsening financials if — or when — another bear market hits. Mike Foy, chief financial officer at Amina Bank, told Cointelegraph that it’s still too early to tell whether crypto-treasury strategies are sustainable in the long run. In the meantime, he said it’s important to determine whether companies are pursuing the approach for speculative gains, signaling purposes or as part of a broader strategic plan. “If any of these [purchases] seem strange or out of the ordinary, then this is possibly a sign that this isn’t a long-term plan but rather a short-term share price play,” Foy said. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform, drew parallels between ETH-treasury firms and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), noting that the former can offer benefits that ETFs cannot. “Spot ETFs cannot legally offer staking and DeFi,” he said. “Ethereum treasury firms offer higher yields.” Source: Fabdarice Still, Stadelmann cautioned that the model carries significant risks. “ETH treasury firms have risks, such as overleveraging,” he said. In a bear market, this could trigger forced liquidations, potentially creating cascading effects on Ether’s price. Falling ETH prices could undermine debt-financed strategies at companies that acquired their holdings through loans, convertible notes or equity dilution. Of the current digital asset treasury strategies, Ether is the most exposed, with roughly 3.4% of its total supply held by such entities, according to Anthony DeMartino, founder and CEO of Sentora Research.

Those funds ballooned from about $4 billion in 1975 to $235 billion in 1982, outpacing banks whose deposit rates were tightly regulated , Federal Reserve data showed. Withdrawals from bank accounts exceeded new deposits by $32 billion between 1981 and 1982. Sean Viergutz, banking and capital markets advisory leader at consultancy PwC, similarly suggested that a shift from consumers to higher-yielding stablecoins could spell trouble for the banking sector. “Banks may face higher funding costs by relying more on wholesale markets or raising deposit rates, which could make credit more expensive for households and businesses,” he said.

The regulatory setup led to a significant reaction by the banking sector. Several US banking groups led by the Bank Policy Institute have urged local regulators to close what they say is a loophole that may indirectly allow stablecoin issuers to pay interest or yields on stablecoins. In a recent letter, the organization argued that the so-called loophole may disrupt the flow of credit to American businesses and families, potentially triggering $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system. Related: What does the US GENIUS Act mean for stablecoins? The crypto industry is not having it The crypto industry pushed back against banks’ concerns , with two industry organizations urging lawmakers to reject proposals to close the “loophole.” The organizations warned that the revisions would tilt the playing field toward traditional banks while stifling innovation and consumer choice.

Digital asset companies Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital and Jump Crypto are reportedly working to raise $1 billion to buy Solana. A Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources said on Monday that the three companies are looking to form the largest treasury dedicated to Solana ( SOL ). It added that the three companies have tapped Cantor Fitzgerald as lead banker. The plan reportedly involves taking over a publicly traded entity to create a digital asset treasury company focused on SOL. Bloomberg said that the Solana Foundation has endorsed the efforts of the three companies, backing the treasury move. SOL remains the sixth-largest token by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. It currently trades at almost $200, up 6.6% in the last 30 days.

At the time of writing, the biggest Solana treasury belongs to Upexi , a supply chain management brand. On Aug. 5, Upexi announced that its SOL holdings had surpassed 2 million SOL, worth about $400 million at current market prices. Upexi said it’s generating additional value to stakeholders through a staking yield and discounted locked Solana tokens. In addition, the DeFi Development Corporation said on Aug. 4 that it had increased its Solana holdings to 1.29 million SOL, worth $240 million at the time of writing. This made the company the second-biggest corporate holder of Solana tokens. Bitcoin miner Bit Mining recently announced a strategic shift to Solana . On July 10, the company said it planned to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana token reserve. While many companies are jumping into SOL as a corporate treasury asset, the $1 billion push from Galaxy, Jump and Multicoin would surpass those efforts. If implemented, the three companies would create the biggest SOL corporate treasury reserve.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Treasury is exploring whether identity checks should be built directly into decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts, a move critics warn could rewrite the very foundations of permissionless finance. Last week, the agency opened a consultation under the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) , which was signed into law in July. The Act directs the Treasury to evaluate new compliance tools to fight illicit finance in crypto markets. One idea was embedding identity credentials directly into smart contracts . In practice, this would mean a DeFi protocol could automatically verify a user’s government ID, biometric credential, or digital wallet certificate before allowing a transaction to proceed. Supporters argue that building Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks into blockchain infrastructure could streamline compliance and keep criminals out of DeFi. Treasury considers digital ID verification in DeFi. Source: Laz Fraser Mitchell, Chief Product Officer at AML provider SmartSearch, told Cointelegraph that such tools could “unmask the anonymous transactions that make these networks so attractive to criminals.” “Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity can make it easier for platforms to mitigate risk, detect and ultimately prevent money launderers from using their networks to wash the proceeds from some of the world’s worst crimes,” Mitchell said. Related: GENIUS Act to spark wave of ‘killer apps’ and new payment services: Sygnum DeFi ID checks: protect data or risk surveillance? Mitchell acknowledged the privacy tradeoff but argued that solutions exist. “Only the necessary data required for monitoring or regulatory audits should be stored, with everything else deleted. Any data that is held should be encrypted at row level, reducing the risk of a major breach.” However, critics say the proposal risks hollowing out the core of DeFi. Mamadou Kwidjim Toure, CEO of Ubuntu Tribe, compared the plan to “putting cameras in every living room.” “On paper, it looks like a neat compliance shortcut. But you turn a neutral, permissionless infrastructure into one where access is gated by government-approved identity credentials. That fundamentally changes what DeFi is meant to be,” Toure told Cointelegraph. He warned that if biometric or government IDs are tied to blockchain wallets, “every transaction risks becoming permanently traceable to a real-world person. You lose pseudonymity and, by extension, the ability to transact without surveillance.” For Toure, the stakes go beyond compliance. “Financial freedom relies on the right to a private economic life. Embedding ID at the protocol level erodes that and creates dangerous precedents. Governments could censor transactions, blacklist wallets, or even automate tax collection directly through smart contracts.” Related: GENIUS Act yield ban may push trillions into tokenized assets — ex-bank exec Who gets left behind? Another concern is exclusion. Billions of people globally still lack formal identification. If DeFi protocols require government-issued credentials, entire communities, migrants, refugees and the unbanked risk being locked out. “It may restrict access for users who prefer anonymity or cannot meet ID requirements, limiting DeFi’s democratic nature,” Toure said. Data security is also a flashpoint. Linking biometric databases to financial activity could make hacks more catastrophic, exposing both money and personal identity in a single breach. Critics stress that the choice isn’t binary between crime havens and mass surveillance. Privacy-preserving tools like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and decentralized identity (DID) standards offer ways to verify eligibility without exposing full identity. With ZKPs, users can prove they are not on a sanctions list or over 18 without revealing who they are. DID frameworks allow users to hold verifiable credentials and selectively disclose them. “Instead of static government IDs, users hold verifiable credentials they selectively disclose,” Toure said.

ETH is the “most rate-sensitive aspect of crypto” After Powell’s speech, Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged 5% to $117,300 , liquidating $379.88 million in shorts.

In an X post on the same day, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeffrey “Jiho” Zirlin called Ether the “most rate-sensitive aspect of crypto.” “As interest rates drop, the spread between what can be earned by depositing your stablecoins in DeFi vs. depositing your USD in a bank widens,” he said. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , 75% of market participants anticipate a rate cut at the Sept. 17 Fed meeting. Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter said , “It appears Fed Chair Powell is setting the stage for a September rate cut.” Historically, Fed rate cuts increase liquidity and make riskier assets like crypto more attractive. Crypto market participants were expecting the surge However, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem told Reuters on Friday that he still needs more time to decide whether he will support an interest rate cut. “I will be updating my outlook and balance of risks all the way up and until two days, three days before the meeting,” he said.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways : Ethereum has rebounded by over 250% from its April lows. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish stance is fueling the ETH price rally. Bitcoin’s crypto market share has dropped below 60% for the first time since March. Ethereum’s native token, Ether ( ETH ), reached a new record high on Friday, crossing above $4,867 on Coinbase for the first time since November 2021. Ether price is up 250% since April ETH jumped by around 14% on Friday, just as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised the odds of a 25 basis point interest rate cut in September. That brought ETH’s gains to over 250% when compared to its April low at $1,385. “The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said during his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, adding: “Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Powell’s dovish tilt signals looser liquidity ahead, a backdrop that typically bolsters demand for risk assets such as Ethereum. ETH DATs keep stacking, and Powell turns dovish Ether markets are further benefiting from renewed inflows into its US-based ETFs.

Ethereum has also gained significant momentum through growing ETH treasury adoption by corporations . Over the past month, corporate Ethereum treasury firms have acquired roughly $1.6 billion worth of ETH, with BitMine , SharpLink , Bit Digital , BTCS, and GameSquare among the most active buyers. As of Friday, these holdings had ballooned to over $29.75 billion, according to data resource StrategicETHReserve.xyz . Ether is increasingly being viewed less as a speculative token and more as a utility-rich reserve asset, says Ray Youssef , CEO of finance app NoOnes. Standard Chartered has upped its year-end ETH price target to $7,500 from $4,000 and $25,000 by 2028. Some analysts say that the ETH price can reach $13,000 in the coming months. According to analysts at Hyblock, market demand for ETH is likely to continue outpacing available supply. They said, “Usually, when you get to these all-time high levels (psychological levels), you see OGs from 2012-2015 selling, and if that selling/supply isn’t met with real demand, it forms tops. We sort of saw this in the previous price tops, but right now, even if that supply does exist, there is real demand to gobble that up. ETH inflows, treasury companies (BNMR, Sharplink, etc.), along with the Genius Acts’ tailwinds on Ether, DeFi and stablecoins have created a truly perfect storm right now."" Bitcoin dominance decline ushers in “altseason” The rally in ETH has also coincided with a notable drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The global asset manager VanEck has filed an S-1 registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) to launch the VanEck JitoSOL exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to the filing , this fund will hold only JitoSOL, the liquid staking token issued by Jito Network. The submission marks the first attempt to register a US exchange-traded fund backed by a liquid staking token, potentially exposing investors to Solana’s staking yields through a regulated product. JitoSOL represents Solana ( SOL ) locked with validators while providing a transferable token that accrues rewards, a process known as liquid staking. The product would extend VanEck’s expansion into digital asset funds, following its spot Bitcoin ETF launched in early 2024 and Ether ETF earlier that year . Unlike those vehicles, the JitoSOL ETF could test the SEC’s stance on staking. SEC continues to debate staking The move from VanEck comes after Jito Labs and the Jito Foundation co-authored a letter to the SEC on July 31 urging regulators to permit liquid staking tokens like JitoSOL to be included in exchange-traded products, with support from VanEck, Bitwise, Multicoin Capital and the Solana Policy Institute. In the letter, the groups argued that liquid staking tokens provide a safer and more efficient way to integrate staking into exchange-traded products (ETPs), spreading stake across validators and reducing operational complexity. They pointed to available SEC guidance indicating that most forms of staking do not constitute securities transactions, framing liquid staking tokens as consistent with existing rules. That guidance has come in two parts. In May, the SEC’s staff issued a statement saying solo and delegated staking generally fall outside securities laws because rewards are set by the protocol rather than a third party. In August, the agency extended the view to liquid staking , describing receipt tokens such as JitoSOL as evidence of ownership rather than investment contracts — provided the provider doesn’t exert discretionary control. Still, the SEC’s comments are staff statements rather than binding rules, meaning they do not carry the force of law and could be reinterpreted by the Commission or courts. The SEC’s posture on staking has evolved considerably from the past. In February 2023, the agency charged crypto exchange Kraken with offering an unregistered staking program, resulting in a $30 million settlement and the closure of its US staking service. Later that year, the agency sued Coinbase over similar allegations. That case was dismissed in February 2025. Beyond enforcement actions, the SEC has also shaped staking policy through the ETF approval process. When the agency approved spot Ether ETFs in May 2024 , issuers initially proposed the option to stake Ether ( ETH ) held by the funds. The SEC required all references to staking to be removed before approving. US spot Ether ETFs.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Congress of the Philippines is weighing a proposal that could see the country’s central bank establish a strategic reserve of 10,000 Bitcoin, positioning the country among the first in Southeast Asia to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. A House of Representatives bill filed by Camarines Sur Representative Migz Villafuerte in June made headlines on Thursday, as it aims to mandate the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s central bank, to purchase 2,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) annually over a five-year period. The bill, called the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” aims to mandate the BSP to buy 10,000 Bitcoin worth $1.1 billion at current market prices. The bill states that the asset would be locked in a trust for at least 20 years. This would mean that the coins could not be sold, swapped or disposed of, except for when retiring government debt. “This representation deems it vital that the Philippines stockpile strategic assets such as BTC to serve important national interests such as providing financial stability, among others,” Villafuerte wrote, adding that it’s imperative for Congress to write new laws aimed at diversifying the country’s assets to ensure financial security. Philippine lawmaker proposes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Source: Philippine Congress Philippine bill proposes “Bitcoin Purchase Program” The lawmaker described Bitcoin as digital gold, citing its annual growth rate of 40% over the last five years and its recent all-time highs. He said the Philippines must “cash in” on the increasing role of crypto in global markets, pointing toward El Salvador and other nations already exploring and implementing Bitcoin reserve strategies. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act would mandate that the central bank implement a Bitcoin Purchase Program. It would mandate the BSP to hold the asset for a minimum of 20 years before deciding whether to keep holding or sell it. It would also require the central bank to have a proof-of-reserves system. This would compel the central bank governor to provide publicly available quarterly reports on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that include information on holdings, transactions and control of private keys.

On Wednesday, a Redditor started a discussion asking how ETH “hoarding” by treasury companies adds value to Ethereum, which they perceived as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). A community member said that the positive effects lie in the price impact, reducing the circulating supply. In addition, they said that the ETH purchased by institutions may also be staked, which would back the network. Another community member disagreed , saying that there were already “more than enough” stakers in the network and that adding more doesn’t help. The community member argued that having additional stakers from central entities also reduces decentralization, which is touted as one of the core values of the network. Another Redditor said the ETH community needs to see this as a win, saying that it brings attention to ETH, making the asset more valuable. With ETH being up, the user claimed that DeFi utility increases as well because ETH functions as a base asset in many protocols.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED China appears to be weighing the launch of a yuan-backed stablecoin, with an initial rollout in Hong Kong and Shanghai, a surprising shift after years of cracking down on crypto while promoting its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph spoke with two leaders analyzing China’s potential move into stablecoins: Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Patrick Tan, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos. China in the stablecoin race The news, first reported on Wednesday, highlighted Beijing’s ambitions to strengthen the yuan’s role in international finance. Still, experts say the path forward is anything but certain, especially with the track record of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) , the digital yuan. According to Chorzempa, the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay in everyday transactions has left little room for China’s CBDC experiment. That leaves a yuan stablecoin with a different potential role. “I tend to think that probably the most interesting applications of a renminbi [yuan] stablecoin is going to be cross-border payments,” Chorzempa said. “One of the most interesting things about having renminbi stablecoins floating around is, is this going to allow people to get money out in ways that they weren’t through the banks?” Related: China Merchants Bank subsidiary launches crypto exchange in Hong Kong Still, cross-border utility doesn’t erase the credibility gap between the yuan and the US dollar. Chorzempa said: “China is famously anti-crypto… So the interesting thing with this stablecoin idea is: OK, you have something you call a stablecoin, it’s denominated in renminbi, but is it going to have all the same restrictions and surveillance and controls on it that the current forms of renminbi have?” “And if the answer is yes,” he said, “it’s probably not going to be that attractive in comparison to something in USD, which is really freely usable.” Challenging dollar dominance From a market perspective, the hurdles are just as steep. “Ninety-eight percent of all stablecoins and stablecoin transactions are dollar-based,” said Tan. “The biggest crypto asset exchanges globally, Binance, OKEx, Bybit, they’re all linked to the Chinese, and what’s the currency of choice on all of these exchanges? It’s always a dollar-backed stablecoin.” For Tan, the real issue is systemic: “If China wants to make the digital yuan attractive, it needs to make the yuan attractive first. And to make the yuan attractive requires significant, large systemic political and economic changes and reforms, which, given the current climate in China, I think would be extremely challenging at best.” Whether China’s stablecoin push succeeds or stalls, it signals one thing clearly: Stablecoins are no longer just crypto plumbing; they’ve become tools in a larger geopolitical contest over the future of money.

Market participants often speculate that Strategy’s significant Bitcoin acquisitions help push the price of Bitcoin, but Jajodia said the company carefully structures its purchases to avoid impacting the market. Strategy started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020 and, at the time of publication, held 629,376 Bitcoin, worth about $70.85 billion, according to SaylorTracker. Shirish Jajodia spoke to Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast this week. Source: Natalie Brunell “We manage our buys in a way that we are kind of some proportion of the market liquidity,” he explained. “So we do not eat up into the price of Bitcoin,” he added. One way that companies manage significant transactions without affecting market prices is through over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which allow trades to take place privately rather than on public exchange order books. All eyes on Strategy’s Bitcoin buys Jajodia may be correct, as Cointelegraph found that Bitcoin has had mixed behavior around Strategy’s most significant purchases, with some instances where Bitcoin rose, and others where it fell after a Strategy buy. On Nov. 25, the company said it had acquired about 55,000 Bitcoin for $5.4 billion between Nov. 18 and 24, at an average price of $97,862 per coin. Just a few weeks later, on Dec. 17, Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $106,000, amid a broader rally following President Donald Trump’s US election victory, CoinMarketCap data shows . In another case on July 29, Strategy bought 21,021 BTC for about $2.46 billion, yet within four days the price fell nearly 4%, sliding to $113,320 by Aug. 2. Despite this, traders still get excited when Saylor posts a Bitcoin price chart in the hopes the company will announce another large Bitcoin purchase. Strategy is buying Bitcoin “around the clock,” Jajodia says Jajodia said the firm adjusts the timing of its Bitcoin purchases depending on market conditions, but is active in the market most of the time. “We’re actually buying Bitcoin around the clock. Almost every day, every hour, every second we are in the market,” he said. “If it is going down, we can take the opportunity to move faster,” he said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US House added a provision banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) into an almost 1,300-page bill setting the country’s defense policy for the 2026 fiscal year. A revision of HR 3838, the House’s version of a bill implementing the National Defense Authorization Act, was shared on Thursday by the House Rules Committee to include sweeping language banning the Federal Reserve from studying or creating digital currency. The House passed a similar Republican-backed bill, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, in July with a slim vote of 219 - 210, which now has an uncertain future in the Senate. The National Defense Authorization Act and related appropriations bills are seen as “must-pass” national security legislation as they outline how the military will be funded and how it will spend its budget. It’s typical of lawmakers to add non-defense-related provisions that could otherwise be stalled or heavily revised if passed as standalone bills. House leaders promised CBDC ban in defense bill Top House Republicans had promised to include a CBDC ban in the military spending bill in a deal with conservative hardliners in July. A group of Republican holdouts had refused to move three crypto bills forward unless a CBDC ban was guaranteed to pass, stalling a vote to set up floor debate on the bills for over nine hours , the longest in the House’s history. At the time, the House passing the CBDC-banning bill on its own was seen as unlikely due to a lack of support. Debate on the bills eventually moved forward after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said the CBDC ban would be added to the National Defense Authorization Act.

The party’s House leaders had looked to pass a version of the CBDC-banning bill in the last congressional session. A similarly named bill, called the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, was introduced by Representative Tom Emmer in early 2023, but it didn’t progress and died with the last Congress. Emmer reintroduced a version of the bill in the current Congress, and Republicans have backed the effort as aligning with President Donald Trump’s executive order in January prohibiting CBDCs.

Waxman. Ben Waxman, a Democrat representing District 182 in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives, has introduced legislation “to prohibit elected officials from profiting off cryptocurrency while in office.” Waxman introduced HB1812 on Wednesday with eight Democratic co-sponsors in response to what he called “corruption” perpetuated at the federal level by US President Donald Trump. The Pennsylvania lawmaker accused Trump of financially benefiting from crypto projects like his memecoin, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and pushing policies to “roll back federal oversight of crypto markets, shielding these schemes from scrutiny.” “In Pennsylvania, no public official should be allowed to use their office to enrich themselves through cryptocurrency schemes,” said Waxman. “That’s why I’m introducing legislation to prohibit elected officials from profiting off cryptocurrency while in office. This includes launching, promoting, or trading in coins where they hold a personal financial interest.” The claims that Trump and his family have used his presidential campaign and office to personally profit from crypto ventures have prompted pushback from many at the state and federal levels. Several Democrats in the US Congress have proposed legislation similar to Waxman’s in the federal government to ban public officials, including the president, from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets while in office. Related: Crypto miner deserts Pennsylvania site, fails to plug wells: Report Waxman’s bill, if passed, would amend Title 65 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes to require public officials and their immediate families to disclose financial transactions involving more than $1,000 in crypto while in office and for a year after finishing their terms. Exposure to digital assets would include direct holdings as well as those in derivatives, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. It would also require them to divest any crypto holdings within 90 days of the bill becoming law. Potential civil penalties included fees up to $50,000. “The goal here isn’t to ‘criminalize’ crypto, but to close an ethics loophole,” Waxman told Cointelegraph. “Public officials shouldn’t be able to hold or trade digital assets while in office, given the conflicts of interest.” The Pennsylvania representative commented on the possibility of Republican support: “I have introduced several crypto-related bills and none of them have gotten any bipartisan support. One ran in committee last session and it was a party-line vote. It did not advance beyond that vote. None of my other bills have gotten a committee vote.” Pennsylvania rejects Bitcoin reserve plans The proposed crypto ban followed Pennsylvania Representative Mike Cabell’s introduction of a bill empowering the treasurer to invest up to 10% of the state’s funds in Bitcoin ( BTC ). The BTC reserve plan, introduced in November , never left the state’s House finance committee.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Nasdaq-listed Hong Kong construction company Ming Shing Group Holdings said on Wednesday it has agreed to acquire 4,250 Bitcoin for almost $483 million, joining the wave of companies adding cryptocurrency to their treasuries. The deal , if completed, would make Ming Shing Hong Kong’s top Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data , surpassing Buyaa Ineractive International with its 3,350 BTC. “We believe the Bitcoin market is highly liquid and the investment can capture the potential appreciation of Bitcoin and increase the Company’s assets,” said Wenjin Li, CEO of Ming Shing. Ming Shing’s financials show it has been under pressure, with a negative profit margin of 3.9% in 2025 and a $5.35 million loss before interest and taxes, according to Stock Analysis data. Related: The Bitcoin treasury model is breaking, but Strategy’s isn’t. Here’s why Ming Shing will not pay cash for the BTC.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED For years, Washington was considered hostile territory for the cryptocurrency industry. Regulatory crackdowns, lawsuits and policy uncertainty drove many builders overseas and left advocates fighting uphill battles on Capitol Hill. But as Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, explains in the latest episode of the Clear Crypto Podcast, the tide has turned in a dramatic way. Crypto coordination Smith, a longtime policy leader in Washington and former CEO of the Blockchain Association, joined hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson to unpack the shifting US regulatory environment. What was once a fragmented and defensive industry has transformed into one of the most coordinated and effective political movements in recent memory. “At least in the United States, [there was] an all-out assault on crypto, primarily using the securities laws to create confusion and drive builders overseas,” she said. “But if you look at where we were… Crypto has survived and now thrived. And I think it’s going to expand the marketplace to levels we have only been able to imagine to this point.” At the heart of this transformation is the recently signed GENIUS Act , landmark legislation that establishes a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. Smith describes the law as not only a victory for the industry but also a validation of blockchain’s role in the US economy. “It’s really important not just for stablecoins, but for the underlying blockchains upon which the stablecoins are minted,” she said. “Going forward, if we have so much value being traded on these rails, then the government cannot come and attack those rails. It will just be politically untenable.” Lobbying influence The episode also highlights how lobbying has matured within the space. From just a handful of policy advocates in 2017 to hundreds today, crypto has built a presence in Washington that rivals more traditional industries. Smith noted: “We went from having companies that did not want to engage in Washington…to having the absolutely largest super PAC out there. It’s a real political movement.” Related: SoFi to become first US bank to integrate Bitcoin Lightning, UMA The Solana Policy Institute plays a unique role in this ecosystem, representing an entire blockchain network rather than a single company. By amplifying the perspectives of Solana developers, builders and users, SPI is writing a new playbook for how decentralized communities can engage with regulators. Still, Smith says this isn’t about protecting incumbents. Crypto’s advocates are motivated by a belief in creating a fairer, more open financial system, one where people have ownership of their assets and can transact without unnecessary intermediaries.

Leveraging innovative tech to build new payment services isn’t a “new story,” Waller said as he pitched policymakers and the private banking sector to work together on crypto payment infrastructure. “There is nothing to be afraid of when thinking about using smart contracts, tokenization, or distributed ledgers in everyday transactions.” Source: Sergii Gerasymovych Waller’s comments reflected the Fed’s steady pivot toward embracing crypto and its future role in the US payments system. In April, it withdrew guidance from 2022 that served to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities. Last week, the Fed ended its risk-focused “novel activities supervision program” overseeing crypto-related activities, while Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman on Tuesday suggested staff should be allowed to hold small amounts of crypto to better understand the technology. Waller’s pro-crypto views could soon have more weight, as he is considered a front-runner to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair. Powell’s term ends in May 2026 and can only be extended if he is renominated by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. However, Trump has reportedly been pressuring Powell to resign. Buying memecoins with crypto like buying apples with fiat: Waller Waller said DeFi transactions follow the same logic as everyday debit card purchases, comparing the use of stablecoins to buy a memecoin to tapping a debit card at a grocery store to pay for an apple. “I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple and use a digital dollar in my checking account to pay for it. I tap my debit card on a card reader to conduct the transaction. Finally, the machine prints out a receipt, which is the record of the transaction. The same process applies to the crypto world.” “I buy a meme coin and use a stablecoin as the means of payment. The transaction takes place using a smart contract. Finally, the transaction is recorded on a distributed ledger.” GENIUS bill an “important step” for stablecoin adoption The recent signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act marked an “important step” for stablecoin adoption, Waller said, adding that it could help stablecoins “reach their full potential.” Related: US Treasury calls for public comment on GENIUS stablecoin bill He noted that stablecoins could help maintain and expand the dollar’s role internationally — especially in high-inflation countries or those with limited access to physical dollars — while improving retail and cross-border payments. Stablecoin market tipped to increase 615% by 2028 The stablecoin market currently sits at $280 billion, a market the US Treasury estimated in April would reach $2 trillion by 2028.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Several cryptocurrency and blockchain associations advocating for the industry are pushing for a “prompt confirmation” of Brian Quintenz as chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a Wednesday letter to US President Donald Trump, representatives from several crypto organizations reiterated their support for Quintenz’s confirmation in the Senate following the president’s nomination. Signatories included the Crypto Council for Innovation, Blockchain Association, Decentralization Research Center, DeFi Education Fund, The Digital Chamber, Satoshi Action Fund and Solana Policy Institute. The advocacy organizations argued that Quintenz was “exceptionally well-suited” to head the CFTC in part due to his experience with and understanding of digital assets. After being nominated to chair the agency in February, he was referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee, which delayed a vote days before the chamber was scheduled to break for an August recess. The committee said that the delay came following a request from the White House. An August report also suggested that Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss pressed Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination, claiming he would not fully enact the president’s crypto agenda as CFTC chair.

Currently, the five-member panel of commissioners is staffed only by acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham, and Commissioner Kristin Johnson. Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero, as well as former chair Rostin Behnam, departed the CFTC earlier this year. Johnson said she would leave before 2026, and Pham said she planned to move to the private sector if Quintenz were nominated, suggesting that the prospective chair could be the sole voice until Trump picked other candidates to staff the agency. In a statement to Cointelegraph, a representative for the Crypto Council for Innovation highlighted the need to confirm CFTC leadership amid the two-commissioner panel, no permanent chair, and pending legislation for crypto market structure. Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the lead voices pushing for the chamber to pass market structure, said the bill — which could clarify the roles the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission will have over crypto — will be signed into law before 2026.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Two of the crypto industry’s leading advocacy bodies are pushing back against Wall Street bankers’ latest attempt to roll back the United States’ newly minted stablecoin law. In a joint letter to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) and the Blockchain Association urged lawmakers to reject recommendations from the American Bankers Association (ABA) and state banking groups. As reported, several US banking groups, led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), have urged Congress to tighten the GENIUS Act by closing what they call a loophole that could allow stablecoin issuers and their affiliates to pay yields indirectly. In a letter sent last Tuesday, the groups warned that failing to address the gap could drain as much as $6.6 trillion from traditional bank deposits, threatening the flow of credit to households and businesses. Banking lobby on stablecoins yield loophole. Source: Bank Policy Institute Related: Coinbase revives stablecoin bootstrap fund to boost USDC in DeFi Stablecoin yield loophole The bankers also argued that while the GENIUS Act bans stablecoin issuers themselves from offering yield, it does not explicitly prevent exchanges or affiliates from doing so on their behalf. They claimed this risks giving stablecoins a competitive edge by attracting users with returns similar to savings accounts, without subjecting them to the same banking rules. The crypto groups accused the banking lobby of trying to re-litigate issues already settled in months of negotiations, warning that the proposed revisions would tilt the field toward traditional banks while stifling innovation and consumer choice. “Payment stablecoins are not bank deposits, or money market funds, or investment products, and thus they are not regulated in the same way,” the crypto advocacy groups wrote. “Unlike bank deposits, payment stablecoins are not used to fund loans,” they added. The letter pointed out Section 16(d) of the law, which allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to conduct stablecoin business across state lines without requiring additional licenses. Banking groups want the clause repealed, but CCI and the Blockchain Association argued that scrapping it would re-create “the same fragmented, balkanized regulatory regime that stifles interstate commerce.” They also pushed back against claims that yield-bearing stablecoins could drain deposits from community banks. They cited a July 2025 analysis by Charles River Associates, which found no significant link between stablecoin growth and bank outflows.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) dropped to its lowest level in almost four months amid a broader decline in crypto treasury firms, a Bitcoin dip and after Saylor indicated the company would lower restrictions on issuing more shares. The stock price has fallen 8% since Monday, and the plunge comes alongside an 8.6% decline in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price since hitting a new all-time high of $124,128 on Thursday. Saylor lowers the threshold for selling MSTR to buy Bitcoin “Strategy today announced an update to its MSTR Equity ATM Guidance to provide greater flexibility in executing our capital markets strategy,” Saylor said in an X post on Monday, including a chart showing changes to the company’s ability to issue shares below its previous limit. Source: Michael Saylor The update specified that when MSTR trades below 2.5 times its net asset value (mNAV) — which shows how much more or less the market values a Bitcoin-holding company than its actual BTC stash — the company can “tactically issue MSTR” to cover debt interest, fund preferred equity dividends, and “when otherwise deemed advantageous to the company.” Some MSTR shareholders slammed the change, arguing it was a stark reversal of its Q2 earnings report, which only mentioned issuing shares below this level to pay debts or fund preferred equity dividends. Others, however, saw it as a positive for Bitcoin, as it would potentially allow MSTR to buy more. Strategy’s mNAV stands at 1.55 at the time of publication, according to Strategy data.

Related: Michael Saylor signals Strategy will buy the Bitcoin dip Another commentator, Josh Man, who claimed to be a prior shareholder, said : “The head of the company said he wouldn’t sell below 2.5 mNAV, so I bought. He made this agreement with the shareholder at the live earnings release. And then he sold below mNAV 2.5.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin maxi and developer Endre Stolsvik said it may be a more feasible option for Strategy. “The ‘no issue below mNAV 2.5’ was too strict, given that we’re far away, now at 1.59,” Stolsvik said. Over the past month, MSTR has declined 21.04%, and is now trading at $336.57. The last time MSTR traded at this level was April 17, when Bitcoin was $84,030. Several other public companies holding Bitcoin have also posted stock price declines over the past month.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Federal Reserve’s top regulatory official said staff from the US central bank should be allowed to invest a small amount in crypto to help them understand the technology. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said at a blockchain event in Wyoming on Tuesday that the regulator should consider allowing its staff to hold minimal “amounts of crypto or other types of digital assets so they can achieve a working understanding of the underlying functionality.” She said: “We will soon be establishing a framework for supervising issuers of these assets,” adding: “There’s no replacement for experimenting and understanding how that ownership and transfer process flows.” Currently, most Fed staffers and their spouses are barred from owning crypto or products that concentrate on crypto, such as exchange-traded funds or shares in crypto companies. The Fed tightened its rules on investments in early 2022 after it was revealed that three top officials had unusual trading activity in 2020, as the regulator took action to support the US economy in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowing crypto could help recruitment, rulemaking Bowman said the Fed staff investment restrictions “may be a barrier to recruiting and retaining examiners with the necessary expertise,” and easing the rules would help existing staff better understand the technology.

On Friday, the Fed said it would end a supervision program for crypto and blockchain-related activities undertaken by banks, which the Biden administration set up in 2023. Also, President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month directing banking regulators to investigate claims of debanking made by the crypto sector and conservatives.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (Aug. 20 at 3:33 pm UTC): This article has been updated to reflect that the US Senate will return from recess on Sept. 3. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins suggested only a small fraction of crypto tokens should be considered securities, as part of the agency’s changing approach to what constitutes a security under its purview. Speaking from the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole on Tuesday, Atkins discussed how the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative to establish rules on digital assets could affect how the agency addresses companies moving forward. He signaled that the SEC would chart its own path, as members of Congress consider bills to establish market structure. “We can not go about looking at [tokens] themselves as necessarily being a security,” said Atkins, adding: “From the SEC’s perspective, we will plow forward and on this idea that just the token itself is not necessarily the security, and probably not. There are very few, in my mind, tokens that are securities, but it depends on what’s the package around it and how that’s being sold.” SEC Chair Paul Atkins speaking in Jackson Hole on Tuesday. Source: Wyoming Blockchain Symposium Atkins’ remarks represented a stark change from those of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said the “vast majority” of crypto assets were securities under the SEC’s standard of the Howey test. Gensler resigned from the SEC in January on the day US President Donald Trump was sworn into office, leading to Commissioner Mark Uyeda becoming acting chair of the agency until Atkins’ confirmation.

Awaiting ‘clear rules of the road’ from Congress While Atkins, as chair, presumably has the authority to interpret SEC rules and guidelines, including those covering digital assets, members of Congress are planning to pass a new law to establish a crypto market structure in September. The US House of Representatives passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in July, and leaders at the Senate Banking Committee said they would “build on” the bill to pass their version of market structure. The Senate is scheduled to return from recess on Sept. 3. Also speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium on Tuesday, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott suggested that as many as 18 Democrats could join with Republicans in supporting market structure legislation.

Speaking from the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in Jackson Hole on Tuesday, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said he expected at least some Democrats to join with Republicans to move forward on the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act following the passage of the Guiding and Empowering Nation’s Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The South Carolina senator said that he had already been making efforts to reach out to Democrats outside of the banking committee to “provide cover” to vote for the bill. “We had 18 Democrats vote for the GENIUS Act,” said Scott. “I believe that we’ll have between 12 and 18 Democrats at least open to voting for market structure, a far more complicated piece of legislation, and the forces against it [...] it is a real force to overcome.” Senator Tim Scott speaking in Jackson Hole on Tuesday. Source: Wyoming Blockchain Symposium Before the House passed the CLARITY Act on July 17, Scott said the banking committee planned to pass its version of digital asset market structure “before the end of September.” A draft version of the Senate bill, released in July and tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, “builds on” the CLARITY Act, according to Republican leadership , but may be different from the House legislation. Related: Ex-White House crypto director Bo Hines takes Tether advisory role Realistic expectations for bipartisan support? Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the Senate, making it likely they will need some Democrats to pass legislation for crypto market structure. In addition to Scott’s remarks from Wyoming, Senator Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the banking committee, commented on the CLARITY Act during the congressional recess. “We need crypto regulation,” said Warren in an Aug. 10 interview. “But we don’t need regulation written by the crypto industry... We need regulation that limits the corruption and the ability of elected officials to trade in it, that also limits the ability to blow up the economy with crypto.” More than 70 Democrats in the House of Representatives sided with Republicans to pass the CLARITY Act in July, suggesting that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the Senate may consider supporting the bill.

In March, Hines suggested the US government could revalue its gold holdings and convert part of them to Bitcoin to build a national reserve without adding to the federal budget. The proposal aligned with “budget-neutral” strategies outlined in Trump’s executive order. A month later, Hines said the administration was exploring other “creative ways” to increase its Bitcoin holdings, including using revenue from import tariffs. The executive order also prohibits the government from selling any of its Bitcoin and directs the Treasury and Commerce departments to identify budget-neutral methods to accumulate more.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED South Korea’s top financial regulator ordered crypto exchanges to suspend new digital asset lending services, citing mounting risks and highlighting a need for clear rules. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) said on Tuesday that it sent letters to exchanges requesting the suspension of new crypto lending until it completes guidelines. Existing contracts, like repayments and maturity extensions, will be permitted. On July 31, the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) announced they had formed a joint task force to develop a regulatory framework for crypto lending. The guidelines are expected to cover leverage limits, user eligibility and risk disclosures for virtual asset lending activities. The FSC said it would conduct on-site inspections and take supervisory action against platforms that failed to comply. Forced liquidations highlight urgent need for clear rules The move follows reports of widespread user losses, including thousands of forced liquidations in exchange-run lending programs. One unidentified exchange drew about 27,600 users in a month after launching a lending service in mid-June, the FSC said. The platform recorded about 1.5 trillion Korean won ($1.1 billion) in volume. Of those users, about 13%, or 3,635 people, suffered forced liquidations as their crypto positions fell in value. The FSC also pointed to two companies that offered Tether ( USDT ) lending services, which triggered a surge in selling volume and an unusual decline in USDT prices. The agency said continuing new lending operations without safeguards could further damage investor funds.

This includes Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Travel Rule mandates under the revised Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. In 2023, the country’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act came into force, creating a legal basis for penalties against unfair activities like market manipulation and mishandling of user deposits. Despite these, crypto lending has remained in a legal gray zone, operating without clear regulatory frameworks or a licensing regime.

In a Monday statement following its board meeting, Lib Work announced plans to purchase 500 million Japanese yen ($3.3 million) worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a hedge against “inflationary trends” in Japan and the risks of “holding assets only in cash.” “Therefore, our company has decided to adopt a phased approach to acquisition and holding, in response to these risks and to prepare for future growth areas with overseas operators,” the firm said. Three-month Bitcoin buying spree Lib Work will buy Bitcoin in a series of purchases from crypto exchanges starting in September and continuing until December, while also establishing a risk management system, according to its statement. At current prices, one Bitcoin is worth around $115,377, meaning the company could buy roughly 28 for $3.3 million, making it 105 on the list of top Bitcoin treasury companies, overtaking French payment provider BD multimedia.

First NFT house blueprint goes live Lib Work said in a July 25 statement that one of its house designs, a Lib Earth House Model B, was issued as an NFT and aims to protect the intellectual property and to act as an ownership certificate linked to the physical home. The NFT can store the house’s ID, history, and ownership information on the blockchain to ensure buyers hold exclusive design rights and prevent unauthorized blueprint plagiarism. “Because 3D printed houses are based on digital designs, protecting the rights to these design files and managing their licenses is essential,” Lib Work said. “Currently, blockchain technology and NFTs are expanding beyond the art and music industries into real estate and intellectual property sectors.” NFT blueprints could help solve building challenges In recent years, the construction industry has faced labor shortages and soaring material costs, which, according to Lib Work, show the “limitations of traditional construction methods.” Related: Strategy adds $51M in Bitcoin as price hit $124K ahead of sharp dip The company said 3D printing construction methods and asset digitalization could help solve some of these challenges by reducing labor, time, costs and “creating new international housing markets for the metaverse and Web3 era.” “By creating NFTs for 3D printed houses, Lib Work will build new housing distribution mechanisms for investors and users worldwide, actively promoting international brand value and expansion into new markets.” Lib Work was founded on Aug. 1, 1997.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed rulings on three high-profile crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), extending review deadlines into October. In notices filed Aug. 18, the agency set new decision dates of Oct. 8 for NYSE Arca’s Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, Oct. 16 for 21Shares’ and Bitwise’s Solana ETFs, and Oct. 19 for the 21Shares Core XRP Trust. The Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, submitted on June 24, is structured as a commodity-based trust holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) directly and issuing shares backed by those assets. While branded under US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, it functions like other spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs already on the market. Cboe BZX also seeks approval for the first US spot Solana ETFs through filings from 21Shares and Bitwise. These products would hold Solana ( SOL ) tokens and give investors a secure way to gain exposure to Solana’s price performance. A separate application from 21Shares aims to launch the Core XRP Trust, designed to hold  XRP ( XRP ) and track its market value. First filed in February and later amended, the trust was approaching its 180-day deadline on Wednesday before the SEC granted itself an additional 60 days to review. Related: US regulator considers simplified path to market for crypto ETFs October shaping up as a big month for ETF rulings The most recent ETF extensions are not out of the ordinary. The SEC has been filing ETF extensions all summer, and many of them are shaping up to be decided on this fall. In March, Cointelegraph reported that the SEC had delayed decisions on multiple altcoin ETF proposals, including products tied to XRP, Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Among them was CoinShares’ application for a spot Litecoin ETF , which would hold LTC directly and issue shares backed by the token. Cointelegraph noted that the SEC’s extension placed its deadline in the same cluster of fall reviews as other altcoin filings. Separately, the SEC extended its review of Bitwise’s request to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Now slated for September, that decision would determine whether investors can exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying crypto rather than cash. The SEC often uses its full extension periods to evaluate new products and collect public feedback. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote in a post on X on May 20 that the SEC “typically takes the full time to respond to a 19b‑4 filing.” He added that “almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” and an early decision would be “out of the norm.” Related: Ether ETFs smash records as crypto products see $3.75B inflows BlackRock dominates as ETF funds grow in popularity The US market now counts a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs, several Ether products, and a growing roster of applications for SOL, XRP and other tokens.

In a Monday notice, the Treasury said “interested individuals and organizations” could provide feedback to the government department on “innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies to detect and mitigate illicit finance risks involving digital assets.” Treasury officials said the call for comments by Oct. 17 was part of the requirements under the GENIUS Act. In a Monday X post, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the move “essential” for implementing the law to “[secure] American leadership in digital assets.” After receiving comments from the public, the Treasury will research the methods proposed and submit reports to the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee. The bill to regulate payment stablecoins is expected to go into effect 18 months after it was signed into law on July 18 or 120 days after the US Treasury and Federal Reserve finalize regulations.

The introduction of the new rules led to stablecoin companies operating in Hong Kong posting double-digit losses on Aug. 1 , just after they came into force. Analysts at the time described the sell-off as a healthy correction, as the requirements for stablecoin issuers proved to be more stringent than expected.

Dutch cryptocurrency service provider Amdax is preparing to launch a Bitcoin treasury company on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange, as more European companies follow US counterparts in adopting Bitcoin strategies. Amdax said Monday it is creating AMBTS B.V., a privately held company with independent governance that will operate as a stand-alone firm. AMBTS aims to become a “1% Bitcoin treasury company,” with the goal of eventually accumulating 1% of all Bitcoin ( BTC ) in circulation. The company said it plans to raise capital in stages through the markets to expand its Bitcoin holdings, grow equity value and increase Bitcoin-per-share metrics for investors. Accumulating 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply would require more than $24 billion at current prices, with Bitcoin trading above $115,800 this week. Amdax was the first crypto service provider to register with the Dutch Central Bank in 2020. The platform was among the first Dutch crypto service providers to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) license from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) on June 26. Amdax and AMBTS plan to raise capital from private investors in an initial financing round, with the net proceeds expected to be used to “make a head start with the Bitcoin accumulation strategy,” the announcement said. Amdax said its platform offers 33 cryptocurrencies for trading, automated investing and expert-managed portfolio strategies for users.

Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: China’s central bank stimulus could redirect liquidity into cryptocurrencies. Rising US Treasury yields suggest lower risk aversion, supporting potential recovery in altcoin markets. Central banks stimulate growth by reducing interest rates or enabling special financing conditions, effectively increasing the money supply. This dynamic benefits risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Traders now question if the Chinese central bank’s next move will provide the liquidity boost that finally drives altcoins beyond their previous all-time highs. Economic stimulus is beneficial for the cryptocurrency market A March 2025 21Shares report highlighted a striking 94% correlation between Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price and global liquidity, surpassing both the S&P 500 and gold.

Source: Porkopolis Economics On Thursday, China reported a 0.1% decline in July retail sales compared with the prior month. Goldman Sachs estimates show that in July alone, investments in fixed assets fell 5.3% year-over-year, the steepest contraction since March 2020. Meanwhile, industrial production rose by just 0.4% during the month. China’s survey-based urban unemployment rate also climbed to 5.2% in July, up from 5% in June. Bloomberg Economics analysts Chang Shu and Eric Zhu noted that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) could introduce stimulus measures “as soon as September.” Similarly, economists at Nomura and Commerzbank argued that it is only a matter of time before stronger support policies arrive. Still, even if the PBOC adopts a more expansionist stance, cryptocurrency investors may hesitate if global recession fears intensify. US consumer sentiment deteriorates, but traders are not fearful The University of Michigan’s consumer survey , released on Friday, showed that 60% of Americans expect unemployment to worsen over the next year, a sentiment last recorded during the 2008–09 financial crisis . Yet markets have remained resilient. The S&P 500 closed at a new all-time high, while yields on 5-year Treasurys also moved higher, suggesting investors still lean toward optimism. Related: Bitcoin’s all-time high gains vanished hours later: Here’s why US five-year Treasury yields. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph When recession fears rise, demand typically increases for assets backed by the US government, allowing investors to accept lower yields. After dropping to 3.74% on Aug. 4, the lowest level in more than three months, five-year Treasury yields rebounded to 3.83% on Friday. The move indicates traders are becoming less risk-averse, opening space for a rebound in altcoin market capitalization . If China follows through with stronger stimulus, that added liquidity could be the catalyst for a broad rotation into risk assets. In such a scenario, the push from the PBOC may be enough to propel cryptocurrencies to fresh all-time highs.

Illuminati said that US Treasurys remain the dominant entry point for onchain allocators, but the JAAA product is the fastest-growing tokenized fund in the segment. “We are also seeing rising interest in private credit as institutions look for differentiated yield, with more news coming soon on that front,” she added.

The launch will be supported by an anchor pool of capital to ensure broad accessibility from day one. Illuminati added that the S&P 500 is only the beginning, with plans to bring sector-specific and thematic indexes onchain in the near future. “We see strong potential for sector and thematic index products to come onchain next,” she said.

As reported, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is also in discussions with major exchanges , custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm’s director of US equities. “By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” Rowton said. Looking ahead, Illuminati expects public market RWAs such as Treasurys and equities to lead adoption in the short term due to liquidity and familiarity. However, she believes private markets will eventually dominate, as blockchain removes inefficiencies and unlocks hidden value.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Department of the Treasury is seeking public feedback on how digital identity tools and other emerging technologies could be used to fight illicit finance in crypto markets, with one option being embedding identity checks into decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. The consultation , published this week, stems from the newly enacted Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) , signed into law in July. The Act, which sets out a regulatory framework for payment stablecoin issuers, directs the Treasury to explore new compliance technologies, including application programming interfaces (APIs), artificial intelligence, digital identity verification and blockchain monitoring. One of the ideas in the request for comment is the potential for DeFi protocols to integrate digital identity credentials directly into their code. Under this model, a smart contract could automatically verify a user’s credentials before executing a transaction, effectively building Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) safeguards into blockchain infrastructure.

Source: Laz Related: GENIUS Act to spark wave of ‘killer apps’ and new payment services: Sygnum Treasury: digital IDs could cut compliance costs According to the Treasury, digital identity solutions, which may include government IDs, biometrics or portable credentials, could reduce compliance costs while strengthening privacy protections. They could also make it easier for financial institutions and DeFi services to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion before transactions occur. Treasury also acknowledged potential challenges, including data privacy concerns and the need to balance innovation with regulatory oversight. “Treasury welcomes input on any matter that commenters believe is relevant to Treasury’s efforts,” the agency wrote. Public comments are open until Oct. 17, 2025. Following the consultation, Treasury will submit a report to Congress and may issue guidance or propose new rules based on the findings.

Ether ETFs were “asleep” for 11 months, says Balchunas “Ether ETFs’ weekly volume was about $17b, blowing away record, man did it wake up in July,” Balchunas said. It came the same week Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a new all-time high of $124,000 on Thursday, while Ether ( ETH ) came close to reclaiming its November 2021 high of $4,878 on the same day, reaching $4,784 — just 1.94% below — according to CoinMarketCap.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Justice Department has authorized the seizure of more than $2.8 million in cryptocurrency along with cash and other assets as part of a criminal case against an alleged ransomware operator. In a Thursday notice, the Justice Department said it had unsealed six warrants authorizing the seizure of $2.8 million in crypto from a wallet controlled by Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, as well as $70,000 in cash and a luxury vehicle. He has been charged with conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse, computer fraud and abuse, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. ""As alleged in the unsealed warrants, the cryptocurrency and other assets are proceeds of (or were involved in laundering the proceeds of) ransomware activity,"" the notice reads. “Those assets were laundered in various ways, including by using the cryptocurrency mixing service ChipMixer, which was taken down in a coordinated international operation in 2023. Antropenko also laundered cryptocurrency by exchanging cryptocurrency for cash and depositing the cash in structured cash deposits."" The seizure was the latest US government action involving cryptocurrency that could be used to bolster its national stockpile, set up by an executive order from US President Donald Trump in March. On Monday, the Justice Department said it had seized about $1 million in crypto from the ransomware group BlackSuit, and federal officials are seeking to lay claim to $2.4 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized by the Dallas FBI in April. How much Bitcoin does the US government hold? US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made headlines this week after suggesting the government was “not going to be buying” BTC as part of its crypto stockpile plans, shortly before the price of Bitcoin fell below $119,000. He later clarified on social media that the department would be “exploring budget-neutral pathways” to acquire BTC. According to Bessent, the US government’s Bitcoin stockpile comprised assets seized in criminal cases after victims were compensated, totaling about $20 billion as of Thursday. With the Bitcoin price at $117,387 at the time of publication, estimates suggest a US stockpile of 198,012 BTC, worth more than $23 billion.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A group of crypto and fintech executives urged US President Donald Trump to block banks from charging fees for access to their customer data, arguing it stifles consumer choice. A letter sent to Trump on Wednesday accused big banks of looking to “preserve their market position by imposing exorbitant new ‘account access’ fees that would prevent consumers from connecting their accounts to better financial products of their choice.” Crypto exchange Gemini, trading platform Robinhood, along with crypto lobby groups the Crypto Council for Innovation and the Blockchain Association, backed the letter, which claimed the fees would cripple the US crypto, artificial intelligence and digital payments industries. Crypto sways Trump on open banking rule Former President Joe Biden’s “open banking rule” from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, finalized in October last year, allowed customers to share bank data with fintechs for free. The rule was welcomed by the crypto community, but was strongly opposed by leading banking industry groups, which sued the regulator. Trump originally sided with the banks to kill the rule, but backtracked in late July after pressure from the crypto lobby to keep the rule. The Trump administration told a judge it will leave the rule in place while it creates a new one. Fees to tank US crypto clout, group claims Crypto companies, such as exchanges, rely on banking data to connect their users’ bank accounts to the platforms to allow for easier bank-to-exchange transfers. In their letter on Wednesday, the crypto and fintech executives said the bank data fees could “cripple innovative products” or shut them down entirely, which they argued could hurt Trump’s crypto-related policy goals. Source: Financial Technology Association “America’s ability to lead in the responsible development of digital assets depends on safe, reliable on-ramps connecting our banking system to the new ecosystem,” the letter read. “Severing this connection will drive innovation offshore and diminish U.S. influence.” Trump campaigned to make the US a safe harbor for crypto, and the crypto industry supported his presidential run last year to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. “We urge you to use the full power of your office and the broader Administration to prevent the largest institutions from raising new barriers to financial freedom.” Banking groups say crypto wants “government price fixing” However, banking groups led by the American Bankers Association hit back at the letter on Wednesday, saying the group was looking to “undermine free markets and engage in government price fixing.” “The double standard these companies want to perpetuate, where they may charge fees for service while banks are expected to provide the same service to these private companies for free, is absurd.” The banks said the letter was written by “middlemen trying to mislead” Trump into supporting Biden-era policies “for personal profit and the right to free ride off the major investments banks have made in protecting consumers’ data.” The banking and crypto sectors have also been at odds this week over stablecoins, with banking groups urging Congress on Tuesday to close what they claimed is a loophole allowing stablecoin issuers to pay yields on their tokens through affiliates.

The order opened the door for additional Bitcoin purchases via “budget-neutral” strategies that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.” However, no major developments were shared on how those strategies may be executed in the Digital Asset Working Group’s lengthy crypto report last month. Among the budget-neutral strategies that have been floated are the reevaluation of the Treasury’s gold certificates and tariff revenue. One reason for the slow progress may be that the Treasury requires congressional approval to purchase Bitcoin in a budget-neutral manner. US Senator Cynthia Lummis made note of that point, calling on Congress to look closer into the BITCOIN Act she introduced in March. “We’re going to stop selling” Bitcoin: Bessent While no action has been taken on the buying side, Bessent confirmed that the US doesn’t plan to sell its existing Bitcoin holdings: “We’re going to stop selling,” he told FOX Business, adding that he thought the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was currently valued “somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion.” That aligns with BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries dashboard, which reports that the US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth $23.5 billion.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining company backed by members of US President Donald Trump’s family, exercised an option to purchase up to 17,280 application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), hardware for crypto mining, from Bitmain earlier this month. The mining company purchased a fleet of 16,299 Antminer U3S21EXPH units from Bitmain, capable of 14.02 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power, for about $314 million, according to TheMinerMag . The deal also excluded any potential price increases from the Trump administration’s sweeping trade tariffs and import duties, which will impact Bitmain mining hardware manufactured in China. In response to the tariff pressures, Bitmain announced it will open its first ASIC production facility in the US by year’s end. The company also plans on opening a headquarters in either Florida or Texas. Trade tariffs and other macroeconomic pressures have created a strain at all levels of the Bitcoin mining supply chain, as miners and hardware producer alike adjust their economic calculations in response to the shifting financial landscape. Related: Jack Dorsey’s Block targets 10-year lifecycle for Bitcoin mining rigs Mining industry responds to trade tariffs and economic uncertainty The tariffs have spurred the leading mining hardware manufacturers to consider relocating at least a portion of their operations to the US to avoid import taxes slapped on their products. Over 99% of all Bitcoin mining hardware is produced by three manufacturers: Bitmain; MicroBT; and Canaan, according to a study published by the University of Cambridge. Bitmain is the largest mining hardware manufacturing company in the world by a wide margin, with about 82% of the total market share. Mining hardware market share is divided between three large manufacturers. Source: University of Cambridge The Trump administration’s strategy of using trade tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the US has been met with mixed reactions. Critics say the policies are inflationary in the long term and could backfire. Jaran Mellerud, CEO of BTC mining company Hashlabs, said the price increases from the tariffs could lead to a collapse in demand from US miners . ASIC manufacturers will then have inventory, without demand, which they can export to other countries at cheaper prices, Mellerud said . This would drive mining back to other countries and place US miners at a competitive disadvantage, contrary to the Trump administration’s goal of reshoring the crypto industry in the United States.

Federal Reserve interest rate cut odds dropped to 90.5% from 99.8%. Double top signals and short-term pullbacks in BTC price give altcoins room to rally. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has pulled back sharply from its fresh all-time high of $123,400, dropping to $117,400 on Thursday. The correction took place as a hotter-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) data surprised the market. Bitcoin four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The latest PPI print showed annual headline inflation at 3.3%, well above the 2.5% forecast and the 2.3% reading from the previous month. This is the largest monthly rise in US PPI since June 2022. The stronger price pressures stand in stark contrast to cooler July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Tuesday , which outlined headline inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year and core CPI at 3.1%, reinforcing a bullish case for risk assets at the time. While CPI data fueled optimism for a near-term interest rate cut, the hotter PPI release complicates that narrative. Higher-than-expected producer prices signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to delay monetary easing. For Bitcoin, this could limit upside momentum in the short term. Data from CME FedWatch still points to a 90.5% probability of a 0.25% rate cut on Sept. 17, although it’s notable that the likelihood had spiked to 99.8% on Wednesday.

Cointelegraph noted a bearish divergence between price and relative strength index or RSI, after BTC tagged new highs above $123,000, possibly leading to liquidity grab from its previous highs. The immediate price dip also formed a swing pattern failure, outlining possible choppy price action for the next few days.

Currently, the most likely scenario could be a period of sideways consolidation following an 11% rise over the past 12 days. A bullish case would require a decisive close above $120,000 on the four-hour chart. However, the probability of a retest below $117,000 has increased due to a long-term market fractal pattern. On the three-day chart, BTC has formed a double top pattern, a structure previously observed during January. The pattern led to a period of corrections during Q1 2025, during which BTC dropped as low as $75,000. Bitcoin three-day chart.

The Astana International Exchange (AIX), a stock exchange operating within the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) framework, announced the listing of the Fonte Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (BETF) on Wednesday.

US-regulated cold storage for Kazakhstan BitGo’s involvement in Fonte Capital-issued spot Bitcoin ETF marks the first time for the platform to provide institutional-grade Bitcoin access to investors in Central Asia, the company said in a statement on X. “Kazakhstan is entering a new era for digital assets,” the company said, adding that it will offer its custody services through “secure, US-regulated cold storage.” BitGo announced providing custody for BETF on Wednesday.

BitGo’s role is a “double-edged sword” The growing role of platforms like BitGo in spot Bitcoin products worldwide is a double-edged sword, according to Shady El Damaty, digital identity innovator and co-founder of human.tech by Holonym. “On one hand, you’re getting institutional-grade custody right out of the gate, which matters for investor confidence. On the other hand, it highlights how concentrated this layer of infrastructure still is,” he told Cointelegraph. Related: BitGo files for US IPO as crypto custody business surpasses $100B El Damaty highlighted the growing need for local crypto products in developing markets, suggesting that relying on a single global player isn’t a long-term solution, but it still gets products like spot Bitcoin ETFs to market faster. “BitGo’s involvement gives Kazakhstan an instant credibility boost,” he said, adding: “Ideally, countries should be working toward building local custodians that meet the same security standards. That way, you’re not just importing financial infrastructure, you’re growing it at home, giving the market both sovereignty and resilience.” Bakhrom Saydulloev, a local crypto insider and product lead at Mercuryo, echoed El Damaty’s view, emphasizing that strong local custody is crucial for the financial sovereignty of jurisdictions like Kazakhstan. “But right now using a proven global custodian is the fastest route to credibility and foreign capital inflows,” Saydulloev told Cointelegraph. Impact on the market Founded in 2017, AIX is backed by the AIFC, the Shanghai stock exchange, the Silk Road Fund and Nasdaq, handling around $130 million in monthly trades as of July 2025.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US federal debt has reached a record $37 trillion, adding fuel to calls that rising deficits and potential money supply growth may underpin a Bitcoin rally to $132,000 by year’s end. “Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the debt just officially passed the $37 trillion mark,” said Representative Thomas Massie in a Wednesday X post . The US deficit has risen to its latest record high a month after US President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4, which he said would cut as much as $1.6 trillion in federal spending. Analysts said swelling deficits can eventually prompt looser policy, including quantitative easing , which is large-scale bond purchases by central banks that inject liquidity into the financial system.

Bitcoin rose over 925% during the same period, with its historic price growth “directly correlated” with US debt, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget crypto exchange. “Ultimately, this will impact the American monetary system as a considerable amount of cash will be deployed into servicing this debt,” he said. “The more the debt grows, the higher the likelihood of BTC price soaring to new highs.” Moreover, the US government may also start exploring Bitcoin to fix its “massive national debt,” said Lee, adding that the “odds are stacked in favor of Bitcoin.” Elon Musk criticized the spending bill in a June 5 X post , warning that it would “increase the deficit to $2.5 trillion.” Related: BTCFi VC funding hits $175M as investors focus on consumer apps Servicing the debt may also lead to an increase in the global M2 money supply, which could be the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin’s price.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Standard Chartered has raised its Ether price forecast for 2025 to $7,500, up from a previous $4,000 target, citing a surge in institutional buying and the accelerating adoption of stablecoins following recent US regulatory changes. In a report shared with Cointelegraph, the bank said Ether ( ETH ) treasury companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have acquired 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June, almost double the fastest rate of Bitcoin accumulation by similar entities during the 2024 US election cycle. “A lot has changed since our last ETH forecast update in March,” Standard Chartered wrote. “The first strongly positive sign was significant industry engagement from the Ethereum Foundation and Etherialize, two of the organisations behind the Ethereum ecosystem,” it added. The British bank also noted plans by Vitalik Buterin to boost Ethereum’s layer-1 throughput by 10x, enabling more high-value transactions to settle onchain while delegating smaller transfers to layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Base.

GENIUS Act to supercharge Ethereum’s stablecoin dominance Standard Chartered cited the passage of the GENIUS Act in July as another major catalyst. The legislation provides a clear framework for stablecoins, paving the way for mainstream adoption. The bank noted that stablecoins account for 40% of all blockchain fees, with over half issued on Ethereum. The bank expects the sector’s market capitalization to grow eightfold to $2 trillion by 2028, driving both direct and indirect demand for Ethereum through decentralised finance (DeFi) growth, where ETH already holds a 65% share of total value locked. Standard Chartered anticipates ETH will surpass its previous all-time high by the end of Q3 2025, continuing its recent outperformance against Bitcoin. It projects the ETH-BTC ratio will climb from 0.036 to 0.05 as Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthen. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,692, less than 4% from its previous ATH of $4,891 registered in November 2021, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s new long-term outlook sets ETH at $12,000 in 2026, $18,000 in 2027 and $25,000 by 2028.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto venture capital firm Pantera Capital has invested $300 million into companies with crypto treasuries, predicting that their yields will be better than crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Pantera ’s general partner, Cosmo Jiang, and content head Erik Lowe said on Tuesday that digital asset treasuries (DATs) “can generate yield to grow net asset value per share, resulting in more underlying token ownership over time than just holding spot.” They added: “Therefore, owning a DAT could offer higher return potential compared to holding tokens directly or through an ETF.” Pantera has deployed more than $300 million into crypto treasury firms based in the US, the UK and Israel that hold various tokens, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and several other altcoins. “These DATs are taking advantage of their unique situations to employ strategies to grow their digital asset holdings in a per-share accretive way,” Jiang and Lowe said. So-called crypto treasury companies are the hottest trend on Wall Street, having collected billions of dollars from investors and seen their share prices soar. Still, some have warned that the market has become crowded and many could collapse. Pantera pins BitMine as model example Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies was the first investment out of the Pantera DAT Fund, as it “exemplifies a company with a clear strategic roadmap and the leadership to execute it.” In two and a half months, BitMine has become the biggest Ether treasury company and has the third-largest holdings of crypto among public companies globally. It holds almost 1.2 million ETH, worth about $5.3 billion, and aims to acquire 5% of the token’s total supply. Related: Ethereum hits new multiyear high as Tom Lee's BitMine plans $20B ETH raise The company’s model increases tokens per share through issuing stock at a premium to NAV (net asset value), using convertible bonds to monetize volatility, and generating staking rewards and decentralized finance yields. Pantera said BitMine’s ability to sustainably execute on its strategy “will play out over time,” but it has already attracted backing from traditional finance institutional heavyweights, including Stan Druckenmiller, Bill Miller and ARK Invest. BitMine’s aggressive accumulation has outpaced Strategy’s.

Over the same period, Ether has gained almost 90%. “We expect that the growth story of the highest quality DATs will come to be appreciated by more institutional investors, just like what has happened with Strategy,” Pantera said. Crypto treasuries not without risk Not all agree that crypto treasury companies are destined to succeed. Earlier this month, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin cautioned that overleveraging could lead to their downfall if not responsibly managed. Framework Venture co-founder Vance Spencer said on Tuesday that most of the ETH scooped up by treasuries “will be placed into onchain borrow markets, drawing stables to loop or farm.” Analysts at Standard Chartered warned in June that the new wave of Bitcoin treasury companies could be in danger of going underwater if Bitcoin’s price drops sharply.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Several US banking groups led by the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) urged regulators to close what they say is a loophole that may indirectly allow stablecoin issuers and their affiliates to pay interest or yields on stablecoins. In a Tuesday letter to Congress, BPI warned that a failure to close the so-called loophole in the new stablecoin laws under the GENIUS Act may disrupt the flow of credit to American businesses and families, potentially triggering $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system. The GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield to holders of the token; however, it does not explicitly extend the ban to crypto exchanges or affiliated businesses, potentially enabling issuers to sidestep the law by offering yields through those partners, the groups said. Source: Bank Policy Institute Offering yield is one of the biggest marketing appeals that stablecoin issuers have to attract users. Some offer yield natively for holders while others, such as users of Circle’s USDC ( USDC ), are rewarded for holding the stablecoin on exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken. The banking groups are seemingly concerned that the wide adoption of yield-bearing stablecoins could undermine the banking system , which relies on banks attracting deposits with high-interest savings products in order to back the loans they make. Stablecoins could undermine credit system, bankers say In the letter, also signed by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Financial Services Forum, BPI noted stablecoins are fundamentally different from bank deposits and money market funds because they don’t fund loans or invest in securities to offer yield. “These distinctions are why payment stablecoins should not pay interest the way highly regulated and supervised banks do on deposits or offer yield as money market funds do.” Allowing payments of interest or yield on stablecoins could lead to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, BPI noted, citing a US Treasury report from April. A chart illustrating how money supply may “reshuffle” into stablecoins under the GENIUS Act. Source: US Treasury Department Such a large shift in the financial system could pose a serious risk to America’s credit system, BPI added. “The result will be greater deposit flight risk, especially in times of stress, that will undermine credit creation throughout the economy. The corresponding reduction in credit supply means higher interest rates, fewer loans, and increased costs for Main Street businesses and households.” Stablecoin market still a fraction of US money supply The total market cap of stablecoins currently sits at $280.2 billion, a fraction of the US dollar money supply, which the Federal Reserve reported as $22 trillion at the end of June.

Listen 0:00 Market Update COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: July US CPI held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, boosting Fed rate cut bets to 93.9% for September. Key price support lies from $117,650 to $115,650, with a deeper drop potentially testing a CME gap at $95,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price could continue to rally after the release of the July US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which shows inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, unchanged from June and below the 2.8% forecast. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1% annually, in line with expectations. On a monthly basis, overall CPI increased 0.2%, easing from 0.3% in June, while core CPI rose 0.3% versus a 0.2% gain previously. The data reinforces a mildly bullish backdrop for Bitcoin, as cooling inflation strengthens the case for monetary easing, a positive factor for risk-on assets. A lower interest rate environment reduces the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin, potentially drawing fresh capital into the market. US interest rate cut possibility for Sept. 17. Source: CME FedWatch Following the CPI data release, market expectations for a September Fed rate cut surged to 93.9%, according to CME FedWatch , as traders priced in a higher likelihood of monetary easing. However, the in-line core CPI figure suggests that underlying price pressures persist, indicating the Fed may still require more evidence before taking action. Looking ahead, next week’s Producer Price Index (PPI, 2.3% estimated) and Core PPI (2.5% estimated) could be key. A softer-than-expected print could confirm a bullish macro setup for Bitcoin, reinforcing lower rate expectations and boosting demand for risk assets like Bitcoin.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView On the technical front, a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart recently broke to the upside. The current pullback could be a retest before continuation toward the primary target of $130,000. Notably, technical analyst Titan of Crypto projects a similar bullish scenario, eyeing $137,000 based on a descending trendline breakout seen on Sunday. However, failure to reclaim $120,000 could invite short-term downside pressure. Immediate support lies in the $117,650–$115,650 zone. This key support area also coincides with the CME gap formed over the weekend, making it a key zone for traders to watch. As noted by Cointelegraph, despite holding higher ground, BTC is not entirely immune to losing the critical $100,000 support, with a deeper correction could test levels as low as $95,000.

ETH futures hit record open interest, but weak leverage demand and rising layer-1 rivals cast doubt on the sustainability of Ethereum’s recent price rally. Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: Ether derivatives data shows weak demand for leveraged bullish positions. Corporations and TradFi favor independent layer-1 chains, challenging Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized finance. Ether ( ETH ) surged to $4,518 on Tuesday as traders showed a higher risk appetite following a modest 0.1% rise in US consumer inflation. Yet, beneath the surface, derivatives data suggests the rally’s strength may be overstated, particularly as some major companies are pursuing their own layer-1 strategies instead of building on Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem. Edit the caETH futures aggregate open interest, ETH. Source: CoinGlass The ETH futures aggregate open interest rose to $60.8 billion, up from $47 billion a week earlier. However, the increase stems mainly from ETH’s price appreciation, as open interest in Ether terms remains 11% below the July 27 peak of 15.5 million ETH. ETH derivatives signal weak demand for leveraged bullish positions Derivatives metrics show reduced demand for leveraged bullish exposure despite strong spot market gains. ETH perpetual futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch The ETH perpetual futures annualized premium is now 11%, considered neutral. Readings above 13% indicate excessive demand for leveraged long positions, last observed on Saturday. This lack of momentum from aggressive traders is notable given the magnitude of the recent price rally. One should assess monthly ETH futures to gain an additional perspective, given that perpetual contracts are retail traders’ preferred instrument. These contracts with a set expiry date typically trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium to spot prices, reflecting the extended settlement period. ETH 30-day futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch After reaching 11% on Monday, the premium fell back to 8% on Tuesday. Despite a 32% increase in ETH price over the past 10 days, leveraged long interest has not returned to levels seen in previous bullish cycles, suggesting unease about Ethereum’s fundamentals and onchain activity trends. Source: X/ techleadhd X user techleadhd noted that Stripe, Circle, Tether, and JPMorgan have launched their own chains rather than adopting Ethereum layer-2 solutions. While this view incorrectly assesses Coinbase and Robinhood, which remain anchored to Ethereum’s base layer, it illustrates that some enterprises prefer layer-1 control and tailored infrastructure. Tokenized assets, including stablecoins backed by traditional reserves, require less decentralization to function effectively. Products from JPMorgan and Stripe aim to keep users within closed ecosystems, not enable withdrawals to public networks. For such models, Ethereum layer-2 integration offers limited incentives. Weak Ethereum onchain activity and layer-1 competition There is growing institutional demand for ETH, reflected in spot exchange-traded fund inflows, yet onchain metrics tell a less optimistic story. The total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum network fell by 7% over the past 30 days. Ethereum TVL (left) vs. Ethereum weekly fees (right).

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform OpenEden partnered with The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY) to manage and custody the underlying assets of its flagship tokenized US Treasury product, TBILL. OpenEden announced the partnership Wednesday, bringing one of Wall Street’s largest and oldest custodians into the growing market for tokenized Treasurys. OpenEden said TBILL is the first tokenized US Treasury fund with a Moody’s “A” rating to have its assets managed by a global custodian. A Moody’s “A” rating means that the asset is of upper-medium-grade quality, which indicates low credit risk and a strong capacity to meet financial obligations. It’s considered safe by traditional finance standards. OpenEden founder and CEO Jeremy Ng said combining their platform with BNY’s “deep fiduciary expertise” allows them to create a new standard of trust in the digital asset space. OpenEden says demand for tokenized US Treasury Bills grew The company said demand for the product has increased, reflecting interest in regulated, onchain cash-management solutions. RWA tracker RWA.xyz data shows that the TBILL’s assets under management (AUM) grew to $287 million, a 156% increase from $119 million on Jan. 1. Ng told Cointelegraph that the asset is available exclusively to professional and institutional clients. He said both traditional and crypto-native institutions are interested in the asset. “On one side, hedge funds and family offices are drawn to the regulated structure, investment-grade Moody’s rating, and access to low-risk yield in an otherwise volatile market,” Ng told Cointelegraph. OpenEden’s TBILL product was launched in 2023 to give investors blockchain-based access to a pool of short-dated US Treasury Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the TBILL token. This means that the TBILL token represents a share of the underlying portfolio of US Treasury Bills that mature in the short term and their associated yield. OpenEden said BNY’s investment management arm, Dreyfus, will act as sub-manager of the TBILL fund. Meanwhile, BNY will serve as the primary custodian for the underlying assets, using its infrastructure. BNY’s global head of investments and wealth, Jose Minaya, said the bank sees itself as a bridge between traditional finance and emerging technology in the digital asset space. He said the partnership will allow BNY to extend its liquidity management expertise, adding that both companies aim to cover the full lifecycle of tokenized assets.

The service lets the bank store private keys and access to funds, and provides bookkeeping services to fund managers in other assets.

Investors taking their crypto assets out of exchanges is typically considered a bullish signal, meaning they could be moving them for long-term storage. In a Monday X post , onchain data platform Token Terminal noted that Ethereum remained the dominant chain for tokenized assets, as the blockchain accounted for about 58% of all tokenized assets across all chains. The company also said that assets staked on the Ethereum network surpassed the $150 billion milestone for the first time. Ether ETFs, treasuries keep on stacking Crypto influencer Anthony Sassano posted that Ether ETFs have bought over 50% of the ETH issued since the Merge in late 2022. The blockchain has issued over 451,000 ETH since its switch to proof-of-stake, while net inflows into the ETFs on Monday bought up 238,000 ETH, Sassano said.

If approved, the federal charter, issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), would allow Paxos to custody customer assets and settle payments nationwide under federal oversight, potentially boosting its appeal to institutional clients. Unlike traditional banks, a national trust bank cannot accept cash deposits or issue loans. “OCC oversight will help build on our historic commitment to maintaining the highest standards of safety and transparency,"" Paxos co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The landmark US GENIUS Act could serve as a major catalyst for stablecoin adoption both domestically and abroad. But rather than simply boosting demand for dollar-backed digital currencies, it may unintentionally push capital into the tokenization market as investors seek yield on their holdings. That was one of the key takeaways from a recent interview with Will Beeson, a former Standard Chartered executive and now founder and CEO of Uniform Labs, a developer of institutional liquidity solutions for tokenized financial markets. A central provision of the GENIUS Act is its blanket ban on yield-bearing stablecoins, which prevents holders from earning interest on their digital dollar balances. According to Beeson, this restriction will accelerate the flow of capital into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). An excerpt of US President Donald Trump’s GENIUS Act fact sheet. Source: White House “With yield-bearing stablecoins off the table, institutions need a compliant way to earn yield while staying liquid,” Beeson told Cointelegraph. “Capital is already shifting.” He noted that trillions of dollars in non-interest-bearing stablecoins are poised to enter digital finance. “Institutional holders aren’t going to sit on idle, depreciating assets. They’ll demand yield — and infrastructure that makes accessing it [...] compliant,” he said, adding: “The next phase isn’t about holding idle stablecoins. It’s about programmatic access to risk-free yield, and the ability to move between cash and high-quality assets at will.” Beeson’s view is shared by Aptos Labs’ Solomon Tesfaye, who told Cointelegraph that the GENIUS Act will benefit tokenization as much as it does stablecoins. To meet this need, Beeson’s Uniform Labs is building Multiliquid, an institutional liquidity layer for tokenized markets that enables programmable, real-time conversion between tokenized assets, such as US Treasurys and money market funds , and stablecoins. Tokenized Treasury and money market funds have witnessed significant growth in 2025. Source: Glassy Nakamoto Multiliquid’s open-architecture design allows compliant issuers to integrate without commercial agreements. While declining to name partners, Beeson confirmed that Uniform Labs is “working with a number of leading institutions, fintechs, and stablecoin issuers” ahead of its production launch later this year. Before launching Uniform Labs, Beeson served as chief product officer at Libeara , a tokenization platform incubated by Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures. Related: Tokenized money market funds emerge as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins Tokenization surge to broaden beyond private credit, government bonds Although the GENIUS Act gives newfound legitimacy to stablecoins — and to digital currencies more broadly — “the next phase of digital assets is focused on asset tokenization,” wrote Sandra Waliczek, a member of the World Economic Forum’s blockchain and digital asset division. Waliczek highlighted tokenization’s potential to level the investing playing field for asset classes like real estate and private equity, which have historically been restricted to wealthier investors. “Tokenization changes this by enabling asset fractionalization, breaking assets into smaller, more affordable units,” she wrote. A snapshot of the nearly $26 billion tokenization market. Source: RWA.xyz So far, the nearly $26 billion tokenization market has largely centered on private credit and government bonds .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED With Congress not scheduled to return from recess for a few weeks, some US lawmakers are already signaling how they plan to address crypto-related legislation passed by the House of Representatives in July. In a Sunday MSNBC Interview, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the more outspoken voices associating digital assets with illicit activities, said she supported regulation of the crypto industry. However, she suggested opposition to crypto market structure through the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity (CLARITY) Act, introduced by Republicans and passed with bipartisan support in the House. “We need crypto regulation,” said Warren. “But we don’t need regulation written by the crypto industry that supercharges this kind of corruption. We need regulation that limits the corruption and the ability of elected officials to trade in it, that also limits the ability to blow up the economy with crypto.” Warren’s statement signaled that she planned to double down on her efforts to rally Democratic opposition to the CLARITY Act, which is expected to be considered in the Senate starting in September. Republican leaders at the Senate Banking Committee said in June that they planned to pass the bill by Sept. 30.

The GENIUS Act, having already been passed by the Senate, was signed into law by President Donald Trump the same week, while the other two bills are expected to be addressed after the congressional August recess. The White House has also been weighing in with recommendations for crypto market structure.

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph ETH has gained 41% in the past month, compared to a 9% increase in total crypto market capitalization.

The lack of appetite for leveraged bullish bets above $4,000 is therefore not unexpected. ETH six-month futures annualized premium.

The lack of bullishness is somewhat concerning given that spot Ether exchange-traded funds attracted $683 million in net inflows between Thursday and Friday. ETH options reflect neutral conditions despite rally The ETH options market provides clues to gauge whether traders missed the rally and are waiting for a better entry or instead expect a price drop below $4,000.

Stronger institutional demand for ETH holdings helps explain this sentiment shift. Publicly traded BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday it added 317,126 ETH to its corporate reserves, valued at $1.35 billion at current prices. Meanwhile, Sharplink Gaming (SBET) disclosed it raised nearly $900 million to expand its ETH reserve strategy. The company already holds about 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet, worth over $2.55 billion at today’s levels. Economic recession risk is the biggest threat to $5,000 ETH Ether’s neutral derivatives readings appear encouraging, especially given that traders failed to anticipate the swift rally from $3,400 to $4,300 in just eight days. The longer ETH price stays above $4,000, the greater the likelihood that traders will gain confidence and initiate bullish positions, which could pave the way for a move toward $5,000 . Macroeconomic conditions and overall risk appetite remain the main obstacles to further gains. Some investors worry that US import tariffs could weigh on global economic growth. However, the expected summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump has eased geopolitical tensions, at least for now.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Strategy is marking five years since its first Bitcoin purchase, a move that has helped its share price surge nearly 2,600% since 2020 and revived it from a 20-year lull. MicroStrategy Inc., which now does business as Strategy, bought its first batch of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on Aug. 11, 2020, spending $250 million to scoop up 21,454 BTC in what founder Michael Saylor called its “new capital allocation strategy.” The company has since spent a total of $46 billion buying 628,791 BTC, the largest Bitcoin holdings among any public or private company, and has inspired other companies to copy its Bitcoin buys. Those buys have propelled MicroStrategy, Inc.

Today marks 5 years since we adopted a $BTC strategy. pic.twitter.com/wZa1NJGeS1 — Strategy (@Strategy) August 10, 2025 Strategy suffered an accounting scandal Saylor founded Strategy in 1989, and the company still sells business analytics software and consulting services. Strategy was a darling of the mid-1990s dot-com bubble, where businesses related to the then-new and widely adopted World Wide Web expanded in value; it debuted on the Nasdaq in mid-1998. The company’s stock climbed in the following years, reaching a closing high of $313 in early March 2000. That peak would stand for 24 years, as later that month the firm disclosed that a review of its accounting practices revealed it had overstated revenue for 1998 and 1999. Its share price fell by over 60% in a day with the announcement and led to a slew of lawsuits, which many consider a pivotal event in bursting the dot-com bubble. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Strategy, Saylor and other executives with fraud; they later settled without admitting wrongdoing and paid millions in fines. Bitcoin revived Strategy shares from 20-year flatline Strategy’s share price didn’t recover after the accounting saga, and briefly dived as low as under 50 cents, but mostly floated around $10 to $20 for the next 20 years. Then it started buying Bitcoin, which helped its share price more than quadruple in the 12 months after its first purchase to more than $70, as the cryptocurrency went from around $11,500 to $50,000 in the same period. Strategy’s vast Bitcoin holdings mean its share price largely follows the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency, and it took 24 years for the company’s stock to beat its March 2000 peak, after MSTR closed trading on Nov. 11, 2024, at $340, on the same day Bitcoin crossed $80,000 for the first time. What’s next for Strategy and Bitcoin? Saylor said in May that Strategy will look to raise $84 billion over the next two years, mostly to continue buying Bitcoin. The company uses a variety of ways to raise capital, such as convertible debt notes and share sales, to fuel its Bitcoin buys.

Source: Bo Hines Related: Donald Trump to get on with Bitcoin reserve ‘in short order’ — Bo Hines Hines advocated for the accumulation of BTC through budget-neutral strategies President Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a national crypto stockpile in January. However, the order limited how the government could acquire additional BTC. The executive order prohibits the federal government from selling any of the US government’s accumulated BTC and directs the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department to find “budget-neutral” strategies to accumulate more of the digital currency. Budget-neutral strategies mean that the only way the US government can acquire new BTC for the reserve is through asset seizures or ways that do not create additional burdens on the US public budget. In March, Hines suggested that the US government should revalue its gold holdings , which are priced at $42.22 per troy ounce, while gold trades at about $3,400 per ounce on the spot market. A portion of the revalued gold could then be converted to BTC, increasing the size of the national Bitcoin reserve, without creating a budget expense.

The structure of the deal is still being finalized, but major investors in technology and crypto have been approached, and discussions are said to be progressing quickly, according to a Friday report from Bloomberg. The move would place World Liberty among a growing wave of digital-asset treasury companies, which are publicly traded firms holding crypto reserves. These companies have raised an estimated $79 billion in 2025 for Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases alone, per the report.

In a Friday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Harvard disclosed holding about 1.9 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF as of June 30. The BTC exposure was valued at more than $116 million, making it the fund’s fifth-largest investment for the period after Microsoft, Amazon, travel technology company Booking Holdings, and Meta. Harvard reported its endowment fund was $53.2 billion as of June 30, 2024, making it the largest among US universities, ahead of Yale, Stanford and Princeton. “The endowment and its asset allocation is [sic] set up to anticipate you’re gonna have some volatile periods,” said Robert Kaplan, Martin Marshall professor of management practice in business administration, in a 2017 video explaining the endowment. Though the endowment appeared to primarily focus on technology company investments in 2025, Harvard reportedly considered buying shares in crypto funds as early as 2018.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Binance has partnered with BBVA, one of Spain’s biggest banks, to act as an independent custodian for customer funds, according to a Friday report in the Financial Times citing two people familiar with the arrangement. The move reportedly aims to restore confidence in centralized crypto investing following scandals such as the FTX collapse and Binance’s own regulatory troubles . The FT report said Binance users can now custody assets with BBVA, offering enhanced security through bank-backed collateral. Binance has also partnered with Switzerland’s Sygnum and FlowBank to serve as independent custodians. With traditional finance stepping in to provide safer, more regulated custody solutions, Binance’s move may help bridge the gap between institutional investors and the crypto ecosystem, according to the FT. The FT’s sources said Binance’s custody deal with BBVA involves customer funds being held in US Treasurys at the Spanish bank. Binance then accepts those assets as margin for trading on its platform, reducing counterparty risk. Cointelegraph contacted Binance to confirm its partnership with BBVA. Binance acknowledged receiving the request but had not provided any further details by publication. Continued access to customer funds The sources told the FT that Binance has partnered with only a handful of banks for independent custody of customer funds, but added that BBVA has a better “name recognition” than other banking partners, adding a layer of trust. On Thursday, Binance also launched a service to support the conversion of crypto to fiat and withdrawal directly to Mastercard for European users, with near-real-time availability. The move aims to streamline off-ramping of funds for users across the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom.

The shared subsidiary will be tasked with building a business model focused on issuing and advancing licensed stablecoins. Per the announcement, Anchorpoint Financial already indicated formal interest in obtaining a stablecoin license with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Aug. 1.

The rules were more stringent than many market participants seemingly expected, leading to a significant sell-off in the shares of relevant local companies.

In an interview with the Bankless podcast released on Thursday, Buterin said the growing number of public companies buying and holding Ether was valuable because it exposes the token to a broader range of investors. “There’s definitely valuable services that are being provided there,” Buterin said. He added that companies buying into ETH treasury firms instead of holding the token directly gives people “more options,” especially those with “different financial circumstances.” So-called crypto treasury companies have become a hot trend on Wall Street, garnering billions of dollars to buy up and hold swaths of cryptocurrencies, with the most popular plays being Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether. Leverage must not lead to ETH’s “downfall” Buterin tempered his support with caution, stressing that ETH’s future must not come at the cost of excessive leverage. “If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game.” He outlined a worst-case chain reaction where a drop in ETH’s price turned into forced liquidations that cascaded and drove the token’s price down, also causing a loss of credibility.

Source: Stuart Alderoty The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020 in a federal court, accusing it of selling the token XRP as an unregistered security. A federal judge delivered a mixed ruling in July 2023, finding some tokens could be considered securities, a decision the agency had appealed. Federal judge ruling on XRP is final With the appeals process for the lawsuit abandoned, the decision made by New York federal judge Analisa Torres in 2023 will be final. Judge Torres ruled that the XRP that Ripple sold on public exchanges did not meet the definition of a security, but the tokens the company sold to institutional investors were sold as unregistered securities. She later ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in fines to the SEC, far lower than the agency’s $2 billion request. The fine and Judge Torres’ ruling triggered the regulator to appeal in October, which Ripple then cross-appealed. SEC’s dismissal was expected The SEC sued Ripple during Donald Trump’s first administration. However, Trump promised during his current and second administration to end regulatory enforcement of crypto, and the SEC has abandoned multiple lawsuits filed against crypto companies. The SEC and Ripple filed a joint motion to the Second Circuit in April to pause the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal after Ripple hinted a few weeks earlier that each would drop their cases . Two came to a settlement in May and asked Judge Torres to dissolve the injunction and lower the $125 million fine against Ripple, which she denied in June, saying that Ripple was still required to follow federal securities laws regardless of the SEC's regulatory pivot. XRP soars over $3 The push toward settlement has been a major catalyst behind XRP’s price rally in recent months, rising nearly 99% from a 2025 bottom of $1.79 on April 9 to a peak of $3.56 on July 22, CoinGecko data shows.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s latest comments on liquid staking have sparked a mix of optimism and concern, highlighting the regulatory gray area surrounding one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. While some in the industry see the nonbinding guidance as a step forward for institutional and retail adoption, others warn it leaves key legal questions unresolved and could face challenges down the line. “First, these guidelines are not law… and they could be contested at some point,” Scott Gralnick, head of institutional staking at Marinade, told Cointelegraph. “The industry needs to continue to work together to forge positive regulatory outcomes. This includes advocating for the market structure legislation that is going to be voted on soon.” Key to the SEC statement is a disclaimer that it represents the views of a division within the agency, not the agency’s overall position. The disclaimer notes that the statement is “not a rule, regulation, guidance, or statement” of the SEC. A source familiar with the process told Cointelegraph that staff guidance is not abnormal and lacks a formal vote from the Commission. That doesn’t mean commissioners are unaware of the guidance, however. Related: What is liquid staking, and how does it work? More complex products Liquid staking, which lets users earn staking rewards while keeping their tokens liquid and usable, is more complex than traditional staking. Even among liquid staking protocols, the technical and operational models can vary widely. The SEC staff’s recent guidance may not fully account for these differences. “This guidance confirms that liquid staking activities are not considered a securities offering,” said Lido Labs Chief Legal Officer Sam Kim. “That said, there are still some open regulatory questions around related areas such as restaking, crosschain staking, and more complex financial products built on top of staking. These areas will still require further regulatory clarification.” According to SOL Strategies Chief Strategy Officer Michael Hubbard, protocols whose operations are purely administrative or ministerial — issue receipt tokens on a one-for-one basis, allowing users to stake without controlling the timing or amount and avoid guaranteed returns — “may find regularity clarity under this framework.” “However, the guidance is highly specific in its parameters and emphasizes that any deviation from the described structure could result in different regulatory treatment,” Hubbard told Cointelegraph. Related: Liquid restaking tokens vs. liquid staking tokens Issues with taxation One of the crucial issues the SEC division’s statement left open is the taxation of rewards gained through liquid staking. The rewards would affect ecosystem participants, including stakers, small and large, who report to tax agencies. “Some questions persist regarding the timing of taxation of staking rewards (whether at receipt or disposition),” Alluvial Chief Operating Officer Evan Weiss said. “This issue is currently under legal review in active cases, and there is significant ongoing advocacy at the congressional level seeking fair staking taxation treatment to support the industry’s continued development. Another key issue is the grantor trust tax rules, which govern how assets are taxed when transferred after death. According to Weiss, these rules are the “main regulatory hurdle hindering staking’s integration within exchange-traded funds” and remain an “unresolved matter.” Magazine: Ethereum restaking — Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards? # United States # DeFi # Staking # Regulation Add reaction","Christopher Tepedino Aug 07, 2025 SEC staff liquid-staking guidance leaves regulatory questions, could be contested The SEC staff guidance on liquid staking could be a boon for institutions that want to include the technology in products, but there’s still uncertainty.",CoinTelegraph,2025-08-07 21:19:35+00:00,2025-12-07 13:48:22.556287,2025-12-07T19:19:56.860431

US President Donald Trump said he would nominate Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to temporarily replace Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Adriana Kugler after her resignation becomes effective on Friday. In a Friday social media post, Trump said Miran would serve at the Fed until Jan. 31, 2026, as the White House will “continue to search for a permanent replacement.” The president had reportedly been weighing economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and two other people to replace Kugler by the end of the week. The next Fed board member will have significant influence over the country’s monetary policy, including federal interest rates. The incoming nomination, which must be approved by the Senate, follows Kugler’s resignation on Aug. 1. No reason was given for her departure. Hassett, also director of the National Economic Council under Trump, disclosed holding a stake in Coinbase Global worth between $1 million and $5 million as of June. Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, reportedly said that blockchain technology could benefit the US central bank with its payment systems.

A bullish regulatory tailwind is forming as the SEC clarifies its stance on crypto, liquid staking and tokenization — with institutional investors and IPOs responding in kind. Listen 0:00 Newsletter COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) historic shift in favor of digital assets is emerging as one of the most significant developments of the current Trump administration. Yet, investors may not fully grasp what it means for crypto adoption and its integration into the core of American financial services. That’s one of the key takeaways from recent remarks by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who believes markets are underestimating the regulatory tailwinds now forming in the world’s largest economy. Project Crypto , the SEC’s initiative to modernize its approach to digital assets, was unveiled last week in direct response to the White House’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The program aims to create clearer, more consistent crypto regulations going forward. This week’s Crypto Biz covers the SEC’s evolving stance, including its latest guidance on liquid staking tokens, Hougan’s bullish commentary, continued institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the growing IPO momentum across the crypto industry. SEC says “certain liquid staking activities” fall outside securities laws In a continued shift toward clearer digital asset regulation, the US SEC clarified this week that certain liquid staking practices do not constitute securities offerings—and therefore do not fall under its jurisdiction. The clarification came via a Staff Statement published on Aug. 5, in which the agency stated that “depending on the facts and circumstances, the liquid staking activities covered in the statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities.” The SEC defined liquid staking as the process of staking cryptocurrencies via a protocol or software, receiving a liquid staking receipt token in return to represent ownership. “Today’s staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff’s view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction,” said SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Liquid staking is already a $57 billion industry across all protocols, according to DefiLlama. Liquid staking on Ethereum accounts for $51 billion of the total. SEC’s pro-crypto shift isn’t fully priced in — Bitwise The market has yet to fully account for the SEC’s increasingly supportive stance toward the crypto industry, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan . He believes investors are underestimating what could be the most bullish regulatory shift for digital assets in recent memory. Hougan pointed to a recent speech by SEC Chair Paul Atkins at the America First Policy Institute, where Atkins championed blockchain as a foundational pillar for the future of financial markets. Hougan admitted the remarks caught him “off guard,” questioning whether the market had truly priced them in. “The most bullish document I’ve read on crypto wasn’t written by some yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC,” Hougan said. Atkins has recently made several pro-crypto statements, telling CNBC in July that “tokenization is an innovation,” and affirming that the era of “regulation through enforcement” is over under his leadership.

According to its latest regulatory filings, the state pension fund held 300,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) as of June 30, valued at approximately $10.7 million. This marks a sharp increase from the 110,000 shares it reported owning a year earlier. Assuming the fund has held onto its position, the value of its Bitcoin exposure has likely grown even further, bolstered by Bitcoin’s recent surge above $110,000 — and a brief spike past $123,000 in July.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update Aug. 7, 9:06 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a response from Paxos. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) reached a $48.5 million settlement with crypto infrastructure company Paxos over its partnership with Binance and alleged failure to uphold sufficient anti-money laundering provisions. Paxos agreed to pay New York state a $26.5 million penalty and will spend an additional $22 million to overhaul its compliance program, according to Thursday’s announcement . NYDFS said Paxos failed to conduct regular due diligence on Binance and saw about $1.6 billion in illicit flows from and to the crypto exchange via its stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD). The regulator ordered Paxos to stop distributing the stablecoin in February 2023. NYDFS superintendent Adrienne A. Harris said: “Regulated entities must maintain appropriate risk management frameworks that correspond to their business risks, which include relationships with business partners and third-party vendors.” Anti-money laundering regulations and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations have become a hot-button issue in the cryptocurrency industry, with many companies seeking regulatory clarity on their legal liabilities and responsibilities under the law. Related: US DOJ could still pursue money laundering, sanctions charges against Roman Storm Paxos faced pushback from the SEC and NYDFS over Binance stablecoin The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent a Wells notice, a warning of potential legal action, to Paxos regarding the BUSD stablecoin in February 2023. SEC officials accused Paxos of distributing “unregistered securities” and violating consumer protection laws by partnering with Binance to distribute the stablecoin. However, the SEC withdrew the Wells notice in 2024. One day later, NYDFS likewise accused Paxos of selling “unregistered securities,” forcing the company to stop distributing the BUSD stablecoin. New York’s financial regulator also said the lack of KYC controls was one of the several reasons for the notice. “Per DFS requirements, Paxos is required to conduct due diligence on every new customer,” a February 2023 notice from NYDFS said. At the time, the regulator also said that although it “authorized Paxos to issue BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain,” it did not authorize “Binance-Peg BUSD” to be issued on any blockchain. “The compliance issues discussed are historical issues that were identified over two and half years ago and have since been fully remediated,” Paxos spokespeople told Cointelegraph. “There are no new claims regarding Paxos’ relationship with Binance or the issuance of BUSD,” the spokespeople continued.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United Arab Emirates (UAE) took a significant step toward harmonizing its approach to crypto regulation. The country’s Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) and the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced a strategic partnership to unify the UAE’s approach to crypto regulations. Last September, the regulators expressed their intention to work together toward unifying crypto frameworks in the country. One feature of the partnership is that it will allow Dubai-based licenses to service the entire UAE, according to a Wednesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the latest development formalizes the agreement between the two regulators and “operationalises that intent” with concrete mechanisms. “In essence, the 2024 MOU was a starting point. The current partnership is its formal and functional implementation,” VARA said. Licensing reciprocity, not automatic passporting While the agreement establishes a mechanism for mutual recognition of licenses between SCA and VARA, it will not offer automatic “passporting” of licenses across jurisdictions. “Licensing reciprocity is a key feature of the partnership, but not automatic passporting,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson clarified that the agreement establishes a mutual recognition mechanism between the SCA and VARA. This means that a VASP licensed by one authority can be recognized by the other. However, they will be subject to coordination protocols and applicable regulatory checks. “This includes AML/CFT assessments, operational readiness, and supervisory alignment, ensuring that national security and compliance standards remain robust,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph. For VASPs operating and wanting to operate in the UAE, the partnership provides regulatory clarity, reduced duplication and a streamlined route to national coverage. The VARA spokesperson said this eliminates the need to navigate “separate, potentially conflicting” approval processes, which “lowers operational risk and improves speed to market.” “It also strengthens the UAE’s global appeal as a credible, innovation-first jurisdiction with a unified approach to virtual asset oversight,” the spokesperson added. SCA forms committee to refine regulations The mechanisms include a unified virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration framework, mutual license recognition, real-time data sharing and joint supervision protocols, cross-jurisdictional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) coordination and the formation of a Legislative Review Committee. The SCA approved the formation of the committee, which is mandated to work with VARA to evaluate and refine crypto regulations in the country in line with international best practices. This signals commitment from both parties to build a globally competitive regulatory environment. Officials from both regulators described the partnership as a major step in positioning the UAE as a leader in crypto governance. VARA CEO Matthew White called the partnership “a pivotal moment” in the journey to future-proof the UAE’s digital economy. At the same time, SCA CEO Waleed Al Awadhi said transparency and trust are central to attracting investment.

The “limited license” will allow Laser Digital to offer OTC crypto options to institutional clients under strict oversight, the company said Wednesday. OTC desks allow institutions to trade large volumes of digital assets directly with counterparties, minimizing slippage and enabling more flexible pricing. These desks are typically used by hedge funds, asset managers, trading firms and other high-volume and institutional clients. The move positions Laser Digital to capitalize on Dubai’s demand for regulated crypto derivatives. The company plans to offer tools for hedging, yield generation and volatility management while regulators assess market readiness and risk controls before broader expansion.

In December 2023, the investment arm of UK-based pension giant M&G invested $20 million in GFO-X , the country’s first regulated Bitcoin derivatives exchange. The funding was part of a $30 million Series B round aimed at launching a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-regulated, centrally cleared platform for Bitcoin index futures and options. Across the EU, crypto derivatives fall under broader financial regulations like MiFID II and EMIR, which impose reporting and clearing requirements. However, most member states have yet to introduce crypto-specific OTC licensing. In the United States, the CFTC permits some institutional trading of crypto derivatives under existing laws, but there is no dedicated licensing framework for OTC crypto options desks. Dubai, by contrast, rolled out its comprehensive crypto regulatory framework in early 2023, with rulebooks covering exchanges, custodians, broker-dealers, and token issuers under VARA.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The United Kingdom’s financial regulator lifted a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail investors in a move welcomed by industry leaders as a step toward aligning the UK with global crypto markets as a digital asset hub. On Friday, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reversed the ban on retail access to cETNs, with regulatory changes taking effect from Oct. 8. The ban was enforced in January 2021, citing extreme volatility and “lack of legitimate investment need.” Lifting the cETN ban reflects a change in the regulator’s approach to crypto assets. In a statement, an FCA executive said the decision reflected how the market had evolved and how crypto-related products are better understood. Industry stakeholders and onlookers shared their thoughts on the development. Some hailed the move as a step toward progress, while others criticized the UK, using satire. Community reacts to FCA lifting the ban on crypto ETNs “We are delighted to see this reversal,” said Ian Taylor, board adviser at CryptoUK and chief operating officer of HT Digital. “Until now, the UK has been an outlier on ETNs. This change reflects the progress we’ve made toward introducing a more proportionate approach to consumer risk.” Taylor told Cointelegraph that CryptoUK, a trade association for the digital asset industry, has been lobbying for more inclusive access to regulated products like ETNs, which track the performance of crypto assets without requiring direct ownership. Riccardo Tordera, the director of policy and government relations at the UK-based payments industry body, The Payments Association, echoed Taylor’s optimism: “The intrinsic nature of crypto means it can be accessed by everyone, from everywhere. The FCA ban on retail access to certain crypto products was hindering the UK’s chances of becoming a global crypto hub.” Tordera told Cointelegraph that the FCA’s decision allows individuals to “make their own choices at their own risk.” He said restricting access to the cETNs had put the UK at a disadvantage, undermining its global competitiveness. “This is a welcome move,” he added. “The FCA ban was extremely protective and was already smoothed when professional investors were allowed access last year.” While some welcomed the move, skeptics also chimed in. WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski summed up the moment with sarcasm, saying, “Britain loves financial risk —just not the kind that involves, say, vegetables or an industrial policy.” Source: Jaime Rogozinski Related: UK crypto hopes stall, but ‘encouraging signs’ are there Crypto derivatives remain banned While the FCA reversed its ban on cETNs, the regulator clarified that crypto derivatives are still prohibited. “The FCA’s ban on retail access to crypto asset derivatives will remain in place,” the FCA said on Friday.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Public companies are scooping up Solana to get a slice of the blockchain’s staking rewards, with three firms recently sharing they’ve purchased more of the token. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining said on Tuesday that it made its first Solana ( SOL ) buy, purchasing 27,191 SOL for $4.5 million, and launching a validator to earn yield by staking the tokens. On Tuesday, Upexi, a brand owner specializing in supply chain management, said it spent most of July buying Solana and increasing its holdings from 735,692 tokens at the end of June to more than 2 million SOL now. On Monday, DeFi Development Corp said it increased its crypto holdings to more than 1.2 million SOL, having bought up another 110,466 tokens. Source: DeFi Development Corp CoinGecko said on Tuesday that the recent buys highlight “a growing trend of Solana exposure among public firms,” with the top four Solana-holding companies controlling over 3.5 million tokens worth more than $591.1 million, representing nearly 0.65% of the SOL circulating supply. Long-term staking plans DeFi Development said after its latest purchase that it would stake its SOL holdings with various validators. The company, formerly called Janover, was mainly a real estate financing company that used an artificial intelligence-powered online platform to connect lenders and commercial property buyers. The firm made its first SOL purchase of 2,858 tokens on April 8 after being acquired by former executives from the crypto exchange Kraken. Upexi CEO Allan Marshall said that July “was a game-changing month” for the company after raising over $200 million for additional SOL purchases and increasing its holdings to more than 2 million tokens. Source: Allan Marshall The firm also staked most of its SOL, which Marshall said earned an 8% yield and pocketed $65,000 a day in revenue. Bit Mining to expand into Solana ecosystem Bit Mining chairman and chief operating officer Bo Yu said the company’s first self-operated validator marked the beginning of a broader effort to build a presence across the Solana ecosystem . “It demonstrates our belief in Solana's potential and our commitment to building meaningful infrastructure that supports its growth, security, and decentralization,” Yu added. Bit Mining announced on July 10 that it was making a strategic shift into the Solana ecosystem, with plans to raise up to $300 million to build a Solana token treasury. Staking yield primary catalyst for purchases In a June 18 report, crypto company BitGo speculated that a growing number of companies are adding Solana to their treasuries specifically for the staking rewards and to stand out after a flood of other firms adopted Bitcoin ( BTC ). Related: Solana block capacity is up 20% and there’s a proposal for it to go even higher “Bitcoin integration into corporate balance sheets challenged traditional treasury thinking, signaling digital assets’ transition into a legitimate institutional asset class,” BitGo said. “Companies adopting Solana gain exposure to reward-generating digital assets, align strategically with emerging blockchain infrastructure, and differentiate themselves in the marketplace.” Upexi currently leads the Solana treasury race with the most significant holdings, according to CoinGecko, with DeFi Development in second, and SOL Strategies , a Canadian public company focused on Solana infrastructure, rounding out the top three.

Binance futures trading volumes hit $2.55 trillion in July, the highest level since January, reported CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartun on Tuesday. “The jump in volume followed a month of sharp price moves in both Bitcoin and altcoins,” he said, referencing crypto’s all-time high market capitalization of $4 trillion that pulled back at the end of July. Other crypto derivatives providers, Bybit and OKX, also had strong activity, with $929 billion and $1.09 trillion in volume, but Binance was the largest by a wide margin, making up more than half of the total volume across all major exchanges, the analyst said. “The increase in trading suggests more users are active again, possibly due to the recent price breakout,” said the analyst. Binance futures volumes hit multimonth highs.

US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins published a speech he gave on July 31 at the America First Policy Institute about how blockchain will be integrated into the financial markets. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan on Tuesday said the speech caught him “off guard” and left him wondering whether Atkins’ vision had been priced into the market. “The most bullish document I’ve read on crypto wasn’t written by some yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC.” “I can’t imagine reading the speech and not wanting to allocate a significant portion of your capital to crypto, or, if you work in finance, a significant portion of your career,” said Hougan. Source: Matt Hougan The crypto markets have gained significantly since the election of US President Donald Trump, who had promised to change the leadership and direction of the SEC. Bitcoin spiked to new all-time highs after former chair Gary Gensler resigned on Jan. 20 and Trump took office. It spiked again when Paul Atkins was sworn in as the new chair on April 21. Under his reign, the agency has dismissed long-running enforcement actions against crypto companies and, most recently, launched Project Crypto, an initiative to establish clear regulations. Still, Hougan said it’s likely the market may not yet fully appreciate the implications of the changes at the SEC. “I’m realizing I have to think bigger — and move to a faster timeline. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” SEC’s Paul Atkin’s vision for crypto During his speech, Atkins said that the SEC, among other initiatives, is considering the best way to ensure rules and regulations don’t stifle the growth of onchain markets. “It’s like the chairman of the SEC took all the best ideas crypto supporters have been promoting for the past decade and packaged them in a single speech, along with details on how the SEC can actually make them happen,” Hougan said. “There’s a lot to unpack in the speech for investors; you could build an entire venture capital firm around the chairman’s vision, creating companies to capitalize on each opportunity he lays out.” Blockchain and super apps at top of list Hougan said blockchains could be primed for growth based on what Atkins said in his speech about all assets, such as stocks, bonds and dollars, moving over to public blockchains . “It doesn’t take a genius to see it: If substantially all assets are going to move onto public blockchains, you want exposure to those blockchains,” Hougan added. At the same time, Atkins’s mention of super apps, which Coinbase and Robinhood have already embraced as a concept , could be another area set to grow. “I’ll go out on a limb here: One of these companies could become the largest financial services company in the world, maybe even becoming the first financial services company worth more than $1 trillion. Atkins just gave them a roadmap,” Hougan said. DeFi could thrive with clear regulations Hougan also predicted decentralized finance (DeFi) apps will benefit from a friendlier SEC, after living in a regulatory gray zone. Related: Crypto entrepreneurs were fleeing America, but we can bring them back Atkins said in his speech that DeFi would play a significant role in the future, after suffering under the yoke of a hostile regulatory environment. “With greater clarity, could these numbers rise by 10x? 50x? 100x? As traditional and crypto markets merge, the opportunity is huge,” Hougan said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain cryptocurrency liquid staking activities do not constitute securities offerings, a notable step in the agency’s ongoing effort to provide clearer guidance on digital asset regulation. “The statement clarifies the division’s view that, depending on the facts and circumstances, the liquid staking activities covered in the statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities,” the regulator said Tuesday, referring to key sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In its Staff Statement, the SEC defined liquid staking as the process of staking digital assets through a protocol and receiving a “liquid staking receipt token,” which serves as evidence of the staker’s ownership. “Today’s staff statement on liquid staking is a significant step forward in clarifying the staff’s view about crypto asset activities that do not fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction,” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a statement.

Related: Crypto Biz: Digital gold rush intensifies as Tether Gold surges, institutions double down on BTC SEC adopts pro-crypto approach under Paul Atkins The announcement follows the SEC’s launch of Project Crypto — a sweeping initiative to overhaul the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading in the United States. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins noted last week, the project was developed in response to recommendations from the White House’s Working Group on Digital Assets Since taking office, Atkins has led a more lenient approach to digital asset regulation, moving away from the agency’s prior “regulation by enforcement” stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. That shift included a May clarification that proof-of-stake protocols do not constitute securities transactions. Under Atkins’s leadership, the SEC has also taken meaningful steps to ease regulatory burdens on cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, on July 29, the agency approved in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) ETFs, allowing authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets rather than cash. The US crypto industry is also gaining momentum from sweeping policy reforms designed to make digital assets more accessible. These include the passage of the GENIUS Act , a landmark stablecoin bill, and House approval of market structure and anti-CBDC legislation ahead of the August recess.

Cango produced 650.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in July, a sharp increase from 450 BTC in June, according to data from Farside Investors. Farside also noted it has added Cango to its miner dashboard while removing Hut 8 due to a lack of monthly production disclosures.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce told an audience of blockchain researchers and practitioners on Monday that lawmakers and regulators need to protect people’s right to transact privately. Her comments come as Roman Storm’s Tornado Cash trial heads toward a verdict. Peirce said in a speech at the Science of Blockchain Conference that privacy-protecting technologies and the right to self-custody crypto should be safeguarded, along with the rights of developers of open-source privacy software, who shouldn’t be held responsible for how others use their code. “We should take concrete steps to protect people’s ability not only to communicate privately, but to transfer value privately, as they could have done with physical coins in the days in which the Fourth Amendment was crafted,” she said. “Although a centralized intermediary or even a DAO deploying a DeFi application could build in restrictions on its use, an immutable, open-source protocol is available for anyone’s use in perpetuity, so requiring that it comply with financial surveillance measures is fruitless.” Peirce’s comments come amid jury deliberations in the trial of Roman Storm , co-founder of the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, which allows users to mask the origin and destination of cryptocurrency from prying eyes. Source: Nate Geraci Stifling privacy technologies slows innovation In the 1990s, governments, for national security reasons, wanted to keep strong cryptography out of private hands, according to Peirce. She noted it took court cases and pushback from cryptographers such as Phil Zimmermann — the developer of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software — to turn the tide, leading to many technological advancements. “The internet could not have succeeded without strong cryptography, so a determined set of cryptographers pushed back and convinced the government that cryptography in private hands was a net positive,” she said. “Because of their hard-fought victory in the courts and the court of public opinion, we daily rely on encryption to send email, engage in online banking, buy from online merchants, communicate with one another through voice and video, and conduct many other daily tasks.” DeFi broker rule should stay dead In the same speech, Peirce also said that regulators shouldn’t be asking businesses to keep a record of who they or their customers transact with, as was nearly enforced by the so-called decentralized finance (DeFi) broker rule . Related: CFTC starts ‘crypto sprint’ with SEC following White House plans “Doing so would deputize us to surveil our neighbors—a practice antithetical to a free society. Nor should we require an intermediary to step in the middle of peer-to-peer transactions,” she said. “As with the internet, technologies that have legitimate uses are better left in the permissionless, available-for-all-to-use category, even though doing so enables people to use them for bad purposes, because taking any other course would impinge fundamental liberties.” Before US President Donald Trump killed it on April 10 , the Biden administration-era DeFi broker rule would have required DeFi protocols to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions, to the Internal Revenue Service. Crypto mixers on trial Storm is standing trial in the Southern District of New York over allegations that criminal elements used the mixing service for money laundering and that Storm is responsible for facilitating their actions. If convicted, he could face up to 40 years in prison. Storm’s defence team and the industry argued that Tornado Cash , like any tool, can be used by both normal citizens and bad actors and the software developers shouldn’t be held responsible for the actions of others. In a similar case, the co-founders of Samourai Wallet are facing charges stemming from their involvement in the crypto mixing protocol. They opted to plead guilty on July 29 after initially trying to get the case dismissed.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The supply of yield-bearing stablecoins has surged since the United States’ passage in July of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, which prohibits issuers from offering yields on stablecoins. Data shows the biggest beneficiaries have been Ethena USDe (USDe) and Sky’s USDS (USDS), which provide a yield when the tokens are staked in their respective protocols. Since July 18, the circulating supply of USDe has increased by 70% to 9.49 billion, placing the market capitalization in third place among all stablecoins. Meanwhile, the USDS circulating supply increased by 23% to almost 4.81 billion, placing its market capitalization in the fourth spot across all stablecoins during the same period, according to DefiLlama. The huge increase in supply of USDe has caused the price of ENA, Ethena’s governance token, to rally by nearly 60% since mid-July, with the current price standing at $0.58, according to CoinGecko. Yield-bearing stablecoins are GENIUS Act winners “Surprising winners in a post-GENIUS era - yield bearing stablecoin supply up a TON despite GENIUS disallowing them in the US, “ co-founder of analytics firm Artemis, Anthony Yim, said in an X post on Monday. Source: Anthony Yim Related: State of stablecoins after GENIUS Act: Expert weighs in Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, told Cointelegraph that tokenholders are increasingly flocking to USDe and USDS as they provide yield by staking the tokens in their respective protocols. “Precisely because the GENIUS act banned issuers from providing yield directly to holders, investors are turning to yield-bearing stablecoins or staked stablecoins to get yield,” Moreno said. “This is why you see stablecoins like USDe and USDs expanding in supply, because they pay yield in a more native way (by staking inside their own protocol).” Stablecoin supply could hit $300 billion by year end The overall stablecoin market has grown from $205 billion at the start of the year to $268 billion at the time of writing, an increase of 23.5%, according to DefiLlama. Morena said total stablecoin supply “could approach $300 billion by the end of year, if the growth trend continues.” Still, Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, said that tokenization efforts by traditional finance players may hinder the growth of stablecoins. Tokenization “enables money market funds to adopt the speed and flexibility that previously made stablecoins unique, without sacrificing safety and regulatory oversight,” Louie said. A July report indicates that the demand for decentralized finance applications on the Ethereum network could rise in the aftermath of the GENIUS Act barring yield-bearing stablecoins. Inflation-adjusted return Stablecoins can generate yield through staking, lending or utilizing real-world assets such as US Treasurys, which generates passive income for their tokenholders. Yield-bearing stablecoins allow tokenholders to earn a real rate of return on their asset. A real rate of return is the inflation-adjusted rate a tokenholder receives. The current headline inflation rate in the US for the month of June stood at 2.7% . In comparison, staked USDe (sUSDe) provides an annual percentage yield (APY) of 10.86% , while staked USDS (sUSDS) provides an APY of 4.75% , which equates to a real rate of return of 8.16% and 2.05% respectively.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A US congresswoman has urged the commodities regulator to investigate its nominated chair, Brian Quintenz, over his ties to Kalshi, a prediction platform regulated by the CFTC. Democratic Representative Dina Titus asked Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chair Caroline Pham in a letter on Monday to open “an inquiry into whether Mr. Brian Quintenz has violated CFTC policies, any applicable federal statute, or his own ethical pledge prior to his Senate confirmation” to chair the agency. “Specifically, I request that you release all relevant communications from or about Mr. Quintenz related to prediction markets and event contracts,” she wrote. “As you are aware, Mr. Quintenz is currently on the board of Kalshi and holds stock options in the company.” A vote on Quintenz’s nomination was recently derailed, having been delayed twice in the past month. Last week, the Senate Agriculture Committee pulled a planned hearing for the nomination at the request of the White House . The administration reportedly still supports the nomination. Congresswoman demands communications be released Titus said a recent Freedom of Information Act request indicated that Quintenz had “sought information regarding Kalshi’s competitors and that he may be involved in agency decision-making prior to his Senate confirmation.” “While I hope Mr. Quintenz is following the law and his own ethical pledge, unfortunately this agency has already proven not to be transparent,” she added, saying the CFTC had disregarded regulations “and the law by allowing the trading of event contracts on sporting events that are illegal gambling.” Source: Dina Titus Titus asked the CFTC to “release all communications between the agency and Mr. Quintenz related to commission matters on prediction markets,” including any attempts to direct people to “communicate with Mr. Quintenz through his private email.” Titus aired concerns about Quintenz in June, posting on X at the time that he “must be asked about his plans for prediction markets” and if he led the CFTC, “every state’s ability to regulate and tax gaming is at stake.” In February, she called prediction markets on sports a “backdoor way to allow sports betting in 50 states” that ignored “consumer protections, responsible gaming, integrity monitoring, and state tax revenue rules and regulations.” “Impractical,” Quintenz won’t regulate Kalshi as sole commissioner Titus said that the steps Quintenz pledged to take if made CFTC chair wouldn’t be practical, as he’s slated to be the only person on the typically five-strong commission steering the agency. Pham has said she’ll leave the agency once Quintenz is confirmed, and the only other current commissioner, Kristin Johnson, said in May she’d quit “later this year” after her three-year term expired in April. Quintenz said in a letter to the CFTC in May that if appointed to run the agency, he’d resign from Kalshi — which is regulated by the CFTC as a Designated Contract Market — and forfeit or divest his shares in the firm and would not participate in any matters involving the company for a year after he resigns. “Mr. Quintenz may be the only commissioner of the CFTC for some time, it seems impractical to believe that he will not make any decisions involving Kalshi for one year, considering the vast amount of regulatory and legal action concerning prediction markets,”  Titus said.

The brothers reportedly told Trump that Quintenz wouldn’t shake up the CFTC enough and that he wasn’t aligned with the president’s agenda, pointing to Quintenz’s suggestion in a testimony in June that the CFTC’s budget needs a boost for its new responsibilities in regulating crypto. It’s a sharp reversal from the twins’ take on Quintenz when he was first nominated by Trump, with Cameron Winklevoss posting on X in February that he was “exactly the leader the CFTC needs” while Tyler Winklevoss wrote the pick was “well deserved” and a “great choice for crypto and for America.” Magazine: Will Robinhood’s tokenized stocks REALLY take over the world?

The expanded leadership team includes Diana Zhang as chief operating officer, Ramona Boston as chief marketing officer, Andrea Williams as chief communications officer and Maxwell Rosenthal as chief human resources officer. The newly appointed executives come from traditional finance firms like Bridgewater, Apollo, Goldman Sachs and Citadel. Grayscale’s founder returns as chairman of the board Grayscale, founded in 2013 by Barry Silbert, is one of the longest-standing crypto investment companies in the industry. It launched the first publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle in the US through Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) , which began trading publicly on OTC Markets in 2015. It manages over $35 billion in assets across four crypto ETFs , including newly converted spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) products. Silbert’s return as chairman of the board comes when Grayscale is positioning itself more aggressively against traditional finance giants in the crypto ETF race. While Grayscale launched the first Bitcoin investment vehicle in the US, it now faces stiff competition from newer entrants like BlackRock and Fidelity , whose lower-fee spot Bitcoin ETFs have quickly gained market share. “When I founded Grayscale in 2013, we saw an enormous opportunity to pioneer a new model for accessing and investing in digital assets,” Silbert said. “Today, I continue to have deep conviction in the company’s long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward.” Currently, Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) brings in more revenue than any other Bitcoin ETF, earning $268.5 million annually, thanks largely to its 1.5% fee, which is up to six times higher than competitors like BlackRock’s IBIT or Fidelity’s FBTC.

Marcus Hughes, with experience at Morgan Stanley and Coinbase, was named global head of regulatory strategy. Galaxy Digital has also tapped traditional finance talent to support its institutional expansion. In late 2024, it hired Tony Paquette, former chief financial officer at hedge fund Point72 and ex-JPMorgan executive, as its chief financial officer . The firm also secured a UK derivatives trading license in early 2025 and expanded its London presence, aligning with its strategy to serve global institutional clients.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The recent passage of the US GENIUS Act was widely celebrated as a major step forward for stablecoin adoption, but a key provision may curb the appeal of digital dollars compared to money market funds, raising questions about whether the bill’s authors were swayed by banking industry pressure to restrict yield-bearing stablecoins. The GENIUS Act expressly bans issuers from offering yield-bearing stablecoins, effectively preventing both retail and institutional investors from earning interest on their digital dollar holdings. Because of this, Temujin Louie, CEO of crosschain interoperability protocol Wanchain, cautioned against viewing the legislation as an unqualified win for the industry. “In a vacuum, this may be true,” Louie told Cointelegraph. “But by explicitly prohibiting stablecoin issuers from offering yield, the GENIUS Act actually protects a major advantage of money market funds.” US President Donald Trump signs GENIUS Act into law on July 18. Source: Associated Press As Cointelegraph reported , money market funds, or MMFs, are emerging as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins, particularly when issued in tokenized form. JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho noted that tokenized MMFs could unlock new use cases, such as serving as margin collateral. Louie agrees, claiming that “tokenization enables money market funds to adopt the speed and flexibility that previously made stablecoins unique, without sacrificing safety and regulatory oversight.” Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY, told Cointelegraph that tokenized MMFs and tokenized deposits “could find a significant new opportunity onchain,” especially in the absence of yield on stablecoin holdings. “Money market funds can operate and look a lot like stablecoins to end-users, but with the difference that they do offer yield,” Brody said. Source: Pledditor According to EY’s Brody, the availability of yield could be a deciding factor between tokenized MMFs and stablecoins. Still, he noted that stablecoins retain certain advantages: “Stablecoins are allowed as bearer assets, which means they can easily be put into DeFi services and other onchain financial services without complicated management of access and transfer controls. If tokenized money market funds have many restrictions that prevent such usage, it’s possible the attraction of yield might not be enough to offset the added operational complications.” Related: Crypto execs center stage as Trump signs stablecoin bill into law The banking industry’s grip on the stablecoin debate The GENIUS Act’s prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins came as little surprise, with Cointelegraph previously reporting that the banking lobby appears to have exerted significant influence over the ongoing policy debate around stablecoins. Back in May, NYU professor and blockchain consultant Austin Campbell cited sources within the banking industry, revealing that financial institutions are actively lobbying to block interest-bearing stablecoins to protect their long-standing business model. Source: Austin Campbell After decades of offering depositors minimal interest, banks feared their competitiveness would be threatened if stablecoin issuers were allowed to offer yield directly to holders, Campbell said. Still, yield-bearing digital assets do exist in the US, albeit under the apparent purview of securities regulation. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security , issued by Figure Markets. The token, called YLDS, offered a 3.85% yield at launch.

The social commerce company said it plans to rebrand as TON Strategy Co., becoming the first publicly traded treasury reserve vehicle for Toncoin ( TON ), the native token of Telegram’s blockchain ecosystem. The offering included about 58.7 million shares and pre-funded warrants priced at $9.51. Investor enthusiasm around the company’s move into crypto sent the stock soaring to a high of $29.33 before settling to about $27 at the time of writing, according to Google Finance.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The long-awaited White House report on cryptocurrency policy recommendations may bring an end to years of regulatory uncertainty for digital asset companies, many of which have struggled with unclear guidance regarding securities laws. US President Donald Trump ’s Working Group on Digital Assets released its crypto policy report on Wednesday, outlining recommendations on market structure, banking regulations and methods to bolster the US dollar’s dominance through stablecoins and crypto tax laws. One of the report’s key proposals is a division of responsibilities between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC will gain authority over spot crypto markets, addressing longstanding concerns about overlapping or conflicting enforcement. Clarifying regulatory oversight limitations between the two agencies will lay the groundwork for a “mature, transparent and scalable crypto ecosystem,” said Edwin Mata, a blockchain lawyer and CEO of tokenization platform Brickken, in a statement to Cointelegraph. Source: whitehouse.gov “Letting each body oversee the instruments that best align with their expertise avoids duplication and confusion,” allowing for “consistent legal interpretations,” Mata said, adding: “This is critical in jurisdictions like the United States, where case law and precedent play a dominant role.” According to Mata, inconsistent regulatory positions in the past led to fragmented legal interpretations, forcing courts to resolve disputes between agencies. He said the report would “promote coherent jurisprudence and allow legal opinions to be formed on solid ground.” Ripple lawsuit resolution sets backdrop The White House’s policy recommendations were published over two months after the resolution of one of the most high-profile legal disputes in crypto history: the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs . The regulatory agency sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the firm raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP ( XRP ) securities sales.

Crypto group makes 18 recommendations to CFTC The President’s Working Group made 18 recommendations to the CFTC, two of which directly concerned the agency. The first direct request to the CFTC was to advance a host of initiatives, including guidance on how cryptocurrencies could be considered commodities, how its registration requirements would work with decentralized finance and guidance to CFTC-regulated entities on what they can do with crypto. The other standalone task for the agency was to consider how to amend rules to accommodate blockchain-based derivatives. An additional 16 recommendations concerning the CFTC were tied up with other financial agencies, such as the SEC and the Treasury. CFTC, SEC told to work together to police crypto Some recommendations the CFTC and SEC were told to work on jointly include coordinating to create a rulemaking process and using “their existing authorities to provide fulsome regulatory clarity.” The two agencies were also told they should create a regulatory sandbox and, longer term, explore how to allow registrants to “offer multiple services within a single user interface.” Related: White House crypto report a mixed bag for Bitcoin advocates Several recommendations tasked Congress with carving out how the CFTC and SEC should divvy up regulating crypto, with the report saying the CFTC should be given “clear authority to regulate spot markets in non-security digital assets.” CFTC says it’s already worked on crypto clarity In a statement on Friday, Pham said the CFTC has already begun working to “deliver on the Administration’s promise to usher in a Golden Age of Crypto.” The agency met with crypto executives earlier this year to discuss the industry and has withdrawn what it called “outdated staff advisories” relating to crypto. It also recently wrapped up consultations on allowing 24/7 derivatives trading and perpetual contracts, a move backed by some crypto companies. Trump has nominated Brian Quintenz, the global head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto venture firm, to lead the CFTC. He is awaiting a nomination hearing, which was slated to take place on Wednesday, but the Senate Agriculture Committee pulled it on request from the White House .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto lobby group DeFi Education Fund has called on the US Senate Banking Committee to rethink how it plans to regulate the decentralized finance industry after reviewing its recently published discussion draft on a key crypto market-structure bill. The response, signed on behalf of DeFi Education Fund (DEF) members including a16z Crypto, Uniswap Labs, and Paradigm, said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 (RFA) bill should be crafted in a more tech-neutral manner, that crypto developers should be protected from “inappropriate regulation meant for intermediaries,” and that self-custody rights for all Americans are “essential.” Legislation should “address illicit finance but not unfairly burden DeFi innovation,” it added in the Friday letter addressed to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott and Senators Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Katie Britt. Senate Banking Committee welcomed the feedback The banking committee requested feedback on the discussion draft to help ensure it builds on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 to promote innovation in the $141 billion DeFi industry without compromising consumer protections or financial stability.

A16z Crypto made its own submission A16z Crypto, the crypto arm of tech-focused venture capital firm a16z, also submitted a separate response to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. A16z’s main criticism of the draft crypto bill is that it risks undermining investor protections by creating dangerous loopholes — especially through its treatment of “ancillary assets.” The firm argues that redefining these assets without major changes is incompatible with existing US securities law, particularly the Howey test. It warns that the proposal could allow insiders to exploit exemptions and dump tokens on the public without regulatory oversight.

While she did not provide a specific reason for her departure, the central bank noted she plans to return to her academic post at Georgetown University. Her term had been scheduled to end in January. “It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,” Kugler said. “I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market.” Kugler’s departure is particularly significant given her role as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the 12-member panel that sets US interest rates. Just days before her resignation was announced, the FOMC wrapped up its July policy meeting with a decision to leave interest rates unchanged.

Unlike cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , which track the price of underlying assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) in custody, crypto ETNs are not backed by any underlying assets and represent debt securities. “Instead of equity in the fund, each traded note of an ETN represents an obligation from a legal entity holding the underlying asset as collateral,” according to the ETN description by the Austrian crypto trading platform Bitpanda.

Source: Bitpanda By investing through an ETN tracking crypto, investors can obtain exposure to physical crypto assets via their regular brokers or banks. ETNs are associated with risks like limited control over their assets, which underscores the importance of purchasing ETNs from reputable institutions to ensure safety, Bitpanda said. Crypto derivatives still banned While allowing crypto ETNs, the UK FCA is yet to make a decision on whether to allow retail investors to access crypto derivatives , which the authority banned alongside ETNs in 2021. “The FCA will continue to monitor market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments,” the regulator stated.

In contrast, centralized exchanges’ (CEXs) volumes plummeted by 22%, showing a big contrast to cryptocurrency ETFs. US allows in-kind for crypto ETFs: No impact on retail Cryptocurrency ETFs have seen remarkable growth since their historic launch in the US in 2024 , with issuers like BlackRock posting a 370% surge in inflows in Q2 2025 and crypto funds breaking multiple records. On Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delivered another crucial decision on crypto ETFs, authorizing issuers to proceed with in-kind creations and redemptions or to exchange ETF shares for the underlying crypto assets. Although the move is largely seen as big news for the crypto industry, ETF analysts like Eric Balchunas say that the event will likely have little to no impact on retail investors. “It’s not a huge impact to retail but more of a plumbing fix. It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas said in an X post on Tuesday. The biggest takeaway from the milestones is that the SEC is ready to treat crypto like a legit asset class, he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ethereum’s 10th anniversary was marked by a significant milestone in terms of institutional crypto adoption, as cryptocurrency treasury firms surpassed $100 billion in collective investments on Thursday. Ethereum’s 10th birthday brought renewed corporate interest in Ether ( ETH ), which saw the 10 largest corporate crypto treasury firms amass over 1% of the total Ether supply since the beginning of June, according to a Tuesday report by Standard Chartered. The bank predicted that corporations will eventually hold 10% of the total Ether supply, which may see the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surpass the bank’s year-end target price of $4,000 per Ether. Ether’s corporate adoption is “happening faster than with Bitcoin during its early treasury adoption phase,” since Ether enables corporations to tap into staking yields and “actively generate value,”  Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken asset tokenization platform, told Cointelegraph. Ethereum turns 10: Here’s how its booms and busts shaped history Ethereum celebrated its 10-year anniversary on Wednesday, with renewed institutional momentum fueling hopes that Ether ( ETH ) could challenge its all-time high set in November 2021. Over the past decade, Ethereum has become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain, with nearly $85 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, circulated an early version of the white paper in 2013. The project raised $18.3 million in its initial coin offering (ICO) and officially launched in 2015 as a blockchain for smart contracts. Its cryptocurrency, Ether, now ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin ( BTC ). Here’s a look back into Ethereum’s first decade, featuring the ICO boom, DeFi summer and the rise and fall of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum’s history has been full of crazes, such as ICOs, NFTs and airdrops.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) called on US lawmakers to revise a draft crypto regulation bill, warning that the proposed framework could open dangerous loopholes and undermine investor protections. In a Thursday open letter to the US Senate Banking Committee, the investment firm urged regulators to close loopholes in the draft crypto legislation. The letter was a response to the discussion draft released in late July . The discussion draft in question builds on the 21st Century Financial Innovation and Technology Act (CLARITY Act) and seeks industry input on the ongoing crypto regulation. A16z points to the definition of ancillary assets, referring to tokens sold with an investment contract that give buyers no equity, dividend or governance rights. “The ancillary asset construct should not serve as the foundation for legislation without significant modifications,” the letter said.

Source: Wikimedia Related: A16z doubles down on LayerZero with $55M investment A16z pushes for “digital commodity” model A16z said the current approach fails to resolve core issues facing crypto markets and would be incompatible with the Howey test, the long-standing legal benchmark for defining securities. The investment firm said this approach “will not resolve the challenges facing crypto market participants.” Instead, the firm recommended adopting the CLARITY Act’s narrower “digital commodity” framework, which it said would provide greater certainty while preserving regulatory simplicity. A16z also said “the Howey test remains a critical component of US securities law” and should stay in its current form. A suggested solution was to “codify a modernized application suited to ancillary assets.” It described proposed changes to the Howey test as “unnecessary—and dangerous—because it seeks to rewrite Howey in a way that departs from settled law and undermines investor protections.” “These changes are not merely problematic—they are incompatible with the broader architecture of U.S. securities law.“ Insider sales should be limited A16z also said that applying securities law to primary transactions and commodity regulations for secondary transactions creates a loophole, allowing issuers to sell ancillary assets to insiders under exemptions, and then resell in the public market without coming under securities regulations. The firm suggested requiring the projects to achieve decentralization by eliminating mechanisms of control. Applying transfer restrictions through those means “can close loopholes that would otherwise arise,” the letter said. According to a16z, this would also prevent insider enrichment at the expense of public investors and ensure that the distinction between the primary and secondary markets remained meaningful: “Once control is relinquished and the project is decentralized, those restrictions should fall away, as the asset’s trust dependencies now resemble those of a commodity.“ Related: Trump plans to pick a16z head of policy Brian Quintenz as CFTC chair: Report A control-based decentralization framework The company urged that regulators should adopt a control-based decentralization framework, which it said “is the appropriate way to evaluate the evolution of an ancillary asset’s risk profile.” The letter said this approach “should be focused on whether any party retains unilateral authority—operational, economic, or governance—over the blockchain system.” This, according to a16z, should be considered when applying the Howey test: “Howey should not be abandoned. Instead, Congress should codify the principles underlying Howey for assets under a control-based decentralization framework.” Protect the plumbers, not the pipes A16z further said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) past focus on the “efforts of others” aspect of the Howey test “has created significant perverse incentives.” It said this leads to lower transparency, exposes users to undisclosed risks and stalls innovation. The letter also said that being involved with the technology at the basis of crypto should not infringe on securities law. “Legislation should clarify that core technology functions necessary for the operation of decentralized blockchain systems—such as running consensus algorithms, mining, staking, and executing smart contracts—do not, in and of themselves, constitute regulated financial activity under US securities or commodities laws,” the letter said.

He also predicted that the US economy is at risk of facing an “economic heart attack” if the government does not reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP. Dalio ups allocation advice for Bitcoin and gold While expecting more economic challenges amid deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, further escalated by the Trump administration’s tariff disruptions, Dalio has repeatedly recommended Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold as major tools to hedge against the crises. In late July, he recommended investors allocate up to 15% into Bitcoin or gold to optimize for the “best return-to-risk ratio,” significantly increasing his previous advice of up to 2% .

Criticisms of Dalio’s grim outlook Although Dalio has gained the reputation of a market oracle after predicting the 2008 crisis, many of his other economic forecasts have attracted criticism. In 1982, Dalio predicted that the global economy was headed toward a depression, which proved to be false, causing massive losses for Bridgewater.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto treasury firms have begun moves to buy over $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrencies this week, in possibly one of the biggest corporate crypto grabs in recent history — particularly for altcoins. Cointelegraph analyzed 16 company statements since Monday, which either announced a plan to buy or raise money for crypto. Ether ( ETH ) was the hottest target. At least five public companies have bought or have promised to purchase over $3 billion worth of ETH, which is around 45 times more than the amount of ETH issued in the past week. The so-called crypto treasury companies are the latest Wall Street fad as traditional financiers, often restricted from being able to directly buy crypto or related exchange-traded products, look to gain exposure to the rapidly growing sector. ETH popularity rises for corporate crypto bet Bitcoin miner BTCS Inc. on Tuesday filed plans to sell up to $2 billion in shares to fund future purchases of Ether. Joe Lubin’s Sharplink Gaming, already the second-largest Ethereum treasury firm, boosted the total further by buying up $338 million worth of ETH with two separate buys on Monday and Thursday. Source: Lookonchain The Ether Machine also scooped up the asset this week, purchasing 15,000 ETH for around $57 million. Meanwhile, two more Ether buying companies were born this week, with the biotech firm 180 Life Sciences Corp rebranding to ETHZilla Corporation in a $425 million deal and merchant banker Fundamental Global rebranding to FG Nexus in a $200 million deal. Crypto treasury companies also hot on altcoins Crypto treasury companies were also dazzled by altcoins this week. The biggest altcoin-buying announcement came from Tron Inc., a penny stock toy company taken over by Justin Sun’s Tron blockchain, which said on Monday it wants to raise $1 billion to buy the blockchain’s Tron ( TRX ) token. Another three companies signalled plans to buy either Solana ( SOL ), Sui ( SUI ) or BNB ( BNB ) — a token with close ties to the crypto exchange Binance. The most notable treasury firm to form this week was CEA Industries, a Canadian vape company turned BNB buying firm after a takeover by investment firm 10X Capital and YZi Labs. The firm once described itself as the family office of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao. It plans to raise at least $500 million with plans to potentially unlock up to $1.25 billion to buy BNB, which was reportedly owned mainly by Zhao and Binance. On Thursday, tech company Cemtrex Inc. said it bought $1 million worth of SOL with the goal of expanding to $10 million, while on Monday, the lender Mill City Ventures III completed a $450 million deal to pivot to buying Sui. Crypto buying firms hold $100 billion, but not without risks Galaxy Research analyst Will Owens wrote in a report on Wednesday that crypto treasury companies collectively held over $100 billion worth of crypto, $93 billion of which was Bitcoin. The business model isn’t without its risks, Owens said, and not all are equally valued as investors apply “widely different” equity premiums to a company’s net asset value. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, for example, had an equity premium of 58%, which Owens said reflected its “scale and maturity,” while Japan’s Metaplanet traded at a premium of 179% due to its “aggressive capital formation model.” Source: Galaxy Research He added that the business model “critically depends on a persistent equity premium to NAV. If the premium collapses, or worse, flips to a discount, the model begins to break.” “The treasury company trade is becoming increasingly crowded,” Owens said. “When hundreds of firms adopt the same one-directional trade (raise equity, buy crypto, repeat), it can become structurally fragile. A downturn in any of these three variables (investor sentiment, crypto prices, and capital markets liquidity) can start to unravel the rest.” Strategy helps boost Bitcoin buys Bitcoin remained a popular choice for crypto treasury firms such as Strategy, with seven companies proposing or buying a total of $2.7 billion in Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, bought 21,021 Bitcoin after raising $2.5 billion from its fourth preferred stock, STRC. The UK’s The Smarter Web Company also spent about $26.5 million on 225 Bitcoin, and Metaplanet bought 780 Bitcoin for around $92 million. One new Bitcoin treasury company was spun up through the energy company ZOOZ Power Ltd. on Tuesday, with plans for a $180 million deal to buy Bitcoin.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Solana infrastructure provider Jito Labs, asset managers VanEck and Bitwise and two other stakeholders are appealing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow liquid staking for Solana exchange-traded products (ETPs). Liquid staking is a form of allocating tokens to a validator while receiving a derivative token in return, effectively meaning the staked tokens aren’t “locked up.” Liquid staked tokens (LSTs) can be traded, used in decentralized finance or even loaned. However, the process introduces additional risks not seen in traditional staking processes. Groups appealing to the SEC, including the Solana Policy Institute and Multicoin Capital Management, argue that liquid staking could improve capital efficiency by allowing ETP issuers to avoid forced rebalancing. “If issuers are forced to limit staking to a set percentage of assets, large creations and redemptions would force rebalancing, thereby increasing the costs of operating the ETP and introducing potential tracking error,” the letter reads. “LSTs could be used to rebalance quickly in that scenario and could even be delivered or received in-kind by [authorized participants]…” Jito Labs and other stakeholders’ letter to the US SEC. Source: SEC Additional benefits cited in the letter include increased security to the network, more product options for investors and additional revenue for ETP issuers. At least nine Solana ( SOL ) ETPs are currently awaiting a decision from the SEC. The letter does not cover the risks of liquid staking, among them being smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities, depegging events and slashing risks. The SEC has not issued formal guidance on liquid staking, though it has said traditional staking may not constitute a securities offering if it’s directly tied to a consensus process. Related: Smart contracts and staking arrive on Bitcoin’s base layer Crypto ETP staking a hot-button issue in 2025 Solana isn’t the only cryptocurrency advocates want to see staked in ETPs. Issuers of Ether ( ETH ) funds are also seeking approval for staking features. On July 17, Nasdaq filed an application with the SEC to allow staking in BlackRock’s iShares Ether ETF. The stock exchange filed similar applications for Grayscale on February. Some analysts are also bullish on the prospect, saying that adding staking to Ether ETFs could allow for an influx of institutional capital into these funds. In March 2025, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, said that while the firm’s Ether ETF has been successful, it has been “less perfect” without staking .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to moderate his long-held skepticism toward digital assets in a CNBC interview Tuesday morning, saying he’s now “a believer in stablecoins” and sees value in blockchain technology. During the interview, Dimon suggested JPMorgan’s shift toward crypto is being driven by customer demand, not conviction. “We’re going to accommodate… It’s what the customer wants, not what JPMorgan wants,” he said, adding that all new financial products come with risk: “There’s never been a new financial product that didn’t entail risk.” JPMorgan has been sharply expanding its footprint in crypto . Dimon confirmed in mid‑July that the bank plans to participate in the space with its deposit coin and broader stablecoin issuance to “understand it and be good at it.” A brief history of Jamie Dimon on crypto Dimon’s comments mark the latest turn in a years-long evolution that has seen him go from one of crypto’s harshest critics to a cautious supporter of some blockchain-based technologies. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud” and said, “you can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air.” He said he thought Bitcoin was “ worse than tulip bulbs ,” (a reference to the crash of the speculative Dutch tulip market in the 17th century), and stated he would fire any JPMorgan trader buying or selling crypto. In 2018, he described Bitcoin as “ useless as a pet rock ,” criticized its use in illicit activities but acknowledged that blockchain technology could have value. At the World Economic Forum in January 2024, Dimon said, “Bitcoin does nothing” and has “no intrinsic value.” As recently as January 2025, Dimon repeated concerns about Bitcoin being used by “sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware,” while reaffirming the potential of blockchain applications .

Solv’s new BTC+ is designed as a Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield vault aggregating and deploying capital across various yield strategies spanning decentralized finance (DeFi), centralized finance (CeFi) and traditional finance markets, Solv announced Thursday. These strategies include protocol staking, basis arbitrage and yields from tokenized real-world assets, notably including BlackRock’s BUIDL fund . Solv said BTC+ operates using a “dual-layer architecture,” which separates custody from the yield-generating strategies, adding another layer of security. “Bitcoin is one of the world’s most powerful forms of collateral, but its yield potential has remained underutilized,” said Ryan Chow, Solv’s co-founder.

Related: Solv brings RWA-backed Bitcoin yield to Avalanche blockchain Bitcoin financialization accelerates as it becomes a premier institutional asset While early crypto adopters have long touted Bitcoin as a superior form of money — citing its scarcity, portability and bearer-asset qualities — its use as a financial asset remained limited until recently, when institutional interest began to surge. Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024, Bitcoin has rapidly become one of the most sought-after alternative investments among institutional investors. Since the ETF approvals, Bitcoin’s price has climbed more than 156%, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $2.5 trillion. This dramatic appreciation, combined with growing institutional adoption, has compelled JPMorgan to consider accepting Bitcoiin ETFs as loan collateral. The financialization trend has even reached federal regulators. As Cointelegraph reported , the US Federal Housing Finance Agency recently directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to evaluate how Bitcoin and other crypto assets might be integrated into risk assessments for home loans. This shift was anticipated late last year, when CoinShares analyst Satish Patel predicted that yield generation would become a priority as institutional Bitcoin holdings grew . On the corporate front, business intelligence company and prolific Bitcoin holder Strategy has introduced a proprietary “BTC Yield” metric to estimate how its Bitcoin treasury strategy contributes to shareholder value.

Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas called the change “a plumbing fix,” noting it won’t meaningfully affect how everyday investors interact with crypto exchange traded funds. “This doesn’t mean retail can exchange IBIT for actual bitcoin,” he wrote on X, “but it shows the SEC is ready to treat crypto like a legit asset class.” The change, announced Tuesday , allows asset managers to exchange crypto tokens directly for ETF shares, instead of using cash. Known as in-kind creations and redemptions, the move cuts out conversion fees, improves price accuracy and makes the ETFs more efficient, ultimately benefiting investors through lower costs and tighter spreads. Large institutions behind crypto ETFs are already adopting the new structure. On Thursday, Bitwise Asset Management announced that its Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) ETFs will begin offering in-kind creations and redemptions, becoming the first US crypto funds to implement the structure following the SEC’s July 29 ruling. “It just makes the pipes a little better,"" Balchunas wrote, adding that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler was against in-kind creations due to concerns over potential funds “sourced from bad places.""

Atkins proposed easing licensing rules to allow for multiple asset classes or instruments to be offered by brokerages under a single license, while also creating a clear market structure separating commodities, which most cryptocurrencies fall under, from securities. Regulatory exemptions or grace periods should be afforded to early-stage crypto projects, initial coin offerings, and decentralized software to allow these projects enough room to innovate, without crushing them under the weight of litigation or fear of reprisal by the SEC, Atkins said. Additionally, the SEC chair said crypto business shouldn’t be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to avoid regulation. He also said the right to self-custody must be protected by law. Atkins wrote : Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century — let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition, from both new entrants and incumbents, to the detriment of Main Street.""

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The White House released its long-awaited report on crypto on Wednesday, detailing a number of policy recommendations that omitted a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. The 166-page document provides recommendations for multiple aspects of the crypto industry, including banking policy, stablecoins and countering illicit finance. The report does mention the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, insofar as it was established back in March, but makes no mention of further development. Bitcoin maximalists have stated that the Bitcoin reserve order should allow the government to actively purchase the asset in a strategy more akin to El Salvador. While the crypto industry has largely welcomed the report and its potential effect on blockchain policymaking, others believe the lack of action on a Bitcoin reserve is a missed opportunity. US President Donald Trump presented the report with Bo Hines (third from left) and David Sacks (third from right). Source: Bo Hines White House crypto report falls short on reserve plans On Jan. 23, just three days after taking office, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. He set a 180-day deadline for policy recommendations. The US government has been in pro-crypto overdrive, leading many observers to expect significant updates to the so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Following news that the White House would include an update to the reserve, Bitcoin historian and advocate Pete Rizzo advised followers to “buckle up.” Source: Pete Rizzo The report contains dozens of references to Bitcoin and its status as the seminal cryptocurrency that sparked the entire crypto industry, but the strategic Bitcoin reserve is mentioned only once at the very end. Even here, the “recommendation” presented by the White House is a simple restatement of the terms laid out in the March 6 executive order, which established the reserve and its concomitant digital asset stockpile. The Bitcoin community expressed its disappointment. CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer of Compass Mining — a US-based crypto mining hosting firm with operations in Ohio and Texas — told Cointelegraph, “The absence of any mention of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in today’s White House report is a missed opportunity. Markets were watching for leadership and instead got ambiguity.” Burnett said that the lack of progress on a Bitcoin reserve creates “unnecessary uncertainty” and risks putting the US behind other countries.

Canadian blockchain and Web3 investor Calvin Ayre said that the mere mention of Bitcoin in the report was already progress: “While many are disappointed at the lack of ‘Bitcoin reserve’ details in the White House report, give them credit for creating a document that at least attempts to explain in detail how all this stuff works.” Bitcoin journalist Susie Violet Ward said the report “represents a clear policy shift. For the first time, Bitcoin is treated as something distinct, quoted, cited, and understood on its own terms.” She said that, while there are scant details on the Bitcoin reserve, “the fact that Bitcoin is being considered a strategic asset, separate from other digital assets, indicates a clear shift in policy tone.” “For Bitcoiners, this is progress.” White House stresses clear policy Bitcoin reserves aside, the report presents detailed policy proposals for how crypto regulations should be updated. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said that the policy proposals laid out in the report are already being implemented in three phases. Demolition phase — where lawmakers get rid of rules implemented during the administration of former President Joe Biden. Construction phase — where lawmakers work with the industry to create laws that would help the industry thrive. Implementation phase — passing the laws. One of the primary goals of the report was to create a “taxonomy” for digital assets to determine which could be securities or commodities. In this regard, it also recommends that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission should share oversight over crypto, with the CFTC regulating spot crypto markets. The report also suggested that banks be allowed to custody crypto and provide crypto-related services to clients. It also stated that the process of getting a banking charter should be easier, with more transparent requirements. Tax, which has long been a sore spot for crypto holders in the US — different agencies all classify crypto differently and recommend it be taxed differently — was also included in the report. The administration recommended that “legislation should be enacted that treats digital assets as a new class of assets subject to modified versions of tax rules applicable to securities or commodities for federal income tax purposes.” Overall, the administration is aiming to enhance crypto adoption through its policies and subsequent legislative efforts to such a degree that a backslide into a more restrictive regulatory environment could never happen, said Hines. The crypto industry gave the moniker “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” to the regulatory environment during the Biden administration. Hines said , “There’s no way that we’re going to face an Operation Chokepoint 3.0. I think one of the greatest ways to prevent that is through adoption.” Adoption of an active Bitcoin reserve, though, will still have to wait, at least for now.

September Fed rate cut chance falls to 40% Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments dampened hopes for a September rate cut, which could lead to a slower crypto bull run, one analyst speculates. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Investors revised down expectations for a rate cut in September after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s non-committal responses to one during a press conference on Wednesday. One crypto analyst suggests it could lead to a slower-paced crypto bull run. The United States central bank decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5%, based on uncertainty about the economic outlook, which it said “remains elevated.” No decisions about September Powell said increased tariffs are beginning to show up in consumer prices for some categories of goods. He did not rule out maintaining rates again at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, adding that it would depend on economic data over the next two months. “We have made no decisions about September, we don’t do that in advance,” he said. “If the unemployment rate holds steady and tariffs push up inflation, it will be hard to justify a rate cut in the next few months,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Reuters. US interest rates remain close to their highest levels in over a decade. Source: Trading Economics Powell defied US President Donald Trump, who has called for lower rates , maintaining his wait-and-see approach amid growing concerns that the ongoing trade war could reverse progress toward the central bank’s 2% inflation target. US inflation is currently 2.7% and has increased for the past four months. Rate cut probability declines Powell’s comments dashed the probability of a rate cut in September to 40% after the meeting. It was at a 63% chance before the FOMC statement. “If the Fed maintains its cautious stance, the bull market’s pace may slow, but the underlying liquidity surge could keep the floor intact for an eventual rebound,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph. “The market had priced in that there would be no rate cut this week, so this is no surprise,” Apollo Capital’s chief investment officer, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph. However, the market still expects one to two rate cuts before year-end. “We don’t think this will have a material effect on the crypto market; it’s been clear for a while that the uncertainty regarding tariffs will delay US rate cuts.” He added that it was interesting that two commissioners dissented, the first time in 30 years that this has happened. Christopher Waller, a governor, and Michelle Bowman, vice chair for supervision, supported the Fed lowering interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Staking approval for US-listed Ether spot exchange-traded funds will bring huge inflows of institutional money into Ethereum, possibly giving Bitcoin ETFs a run for their money, analysts say. Speaking to Cointelegraph, 10x Research’s head of research, Markus Thielen, said staking for Ethereum ETFs would increase the yield and could “dramatically reshape the market.” US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year. NovaDius Wealth Management president and ETF analyst Nate Geraci said in an X post on Wednesday that, given the SEC has recently acknowledged the Nasdaq’s application to add staking to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF, Ethereum ETF staking could be next on the agencies’ “hit list.” Source: Nate Geraci Spot Ether ETFs’ interest could surge after staking approval Thielen predicted that the increased yield would likely result in demand for spot Ether ETFs surging alongside increased activity in Ethereum options markets . The basis trade between spot Ether ETFs and Ethereum futures, already offering around a 7% annualized return, would suddenly become far more attractive, with staking adding an additional 3% yield, according to Thielen. “That brings the total return potential to 10% unleveraged. With 2–3x leverage, institutional investors could target 20–30% annualized returns from this arbitrage strategy,” he said. “This would mark a monumental structural shift in how institutional capital flows into Ethereum, unlocking a new era of yield-driven participation.” Extra yield will make Ether ETFs a compelling portfolio addition Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer of Australian crypto investment manager Merkle Tree Capital, told Cointelegraph that yield is a massive consideration for institutional investors before they pile into an investment. The main reason is that institutions, like pension funds, prioritize steady and predictable income over uncertain capital gains; the yield is also perceived to reduce volatility, according to McMillin. “Ether ETFs will now provide both diversification away from Bitcoin, as digital gold, to ETH as ‘stablecoin infrastructure’ but equally important, a yield which is not applicable for Bitcoin,” McMillin said. “A 3-5% yield will make ETH ETFs a compelling portfolio addition given its growth potential, which is quite unique from a portfolio perspective.” Approval could also boost liquidity and onchain participation Hank Huang, CEO of  Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that staking approval in spot Ether ETFs changes the game for institutions waiting for a compliant way to earn yield onchain without touching private keys. Related: Cboe, NYSE Arca move to streamline crypto ETF listings with SEC rule change request “Ether ETFs offering yield plus asset growth flips the switch on demand, boosting liquidity and sparking greater appetite for onchain participation,” he said. “By combining income and upside, these ETFs will pull in serious capital and drive higher valuations across the ecosystem.” Huang predicts an ETF that blends staking rewards with smooth, flexible exits will raise the bar, setting a “new gold standard” for bringing crypto into mainstream finance .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ether treasury and holding companies have solved Ethereum’s narrative problem by packaging the digital asset in a way that traditional investors understand, drawing in more capital and accelerating adoption, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise. Hougan told Cointelegraph that Ethereum had struggled to define income-producing features for traditional financial investors until its native token, Ether ( ETH ), was packaged in an “equity-wrapper.” Hougan said: If you think about the challenge that ETH has had from a valuation perspective over the last couple of years, it's that Wall Street didn't have a clean answer to why it had value. Is it a store of value? Is it the burn mechanism? Is that revenue? Is it the yield on staking? Who knows?” “But if you take $1 billion of ETH and you put it into a company and you stake it, all of a sudden, you're generating earnings. And investors are really used to companies that generate earnings,” he said. The growing institutional interest in Ethereum highlights the evolution of the layer-1 smart contract blockchain from a niche internet community to an institutional-grade asset 10 years after its mainnet went live in July 2015. Related: Ethereum at 10: The top corporate ETH holders as Wall Street eyes crypto Potential risks to the ETH treasury model Hougan warned that ETH holding companies , those accumulating ETH through corporate bond sales and equity as their core business model, should carefully manage their debt and interest expense to avoid overleveraging and blow-ups . Hougan also advised treasury companies adopting ETH in small allocations as a hedge against inflation to have a long time horizon, adding that short-term volatility might “crush” those with lower timeframes. Ether, like all cryptocurrencies, experiences high volatility and rapid price swings. Source: TradingView He said that basis risk, or the risk of having assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies, is also an issue these companies must contend with, as downturns in the crypto market may affect a company’s ability to meet expenses. However, he clarified that the risk of a “catastrophic unwind,” in which ETH treasury or holding companies are forced to liquidate all of their crypto to meet debt obligations, remains low due to the spaced-out maturity of corporate debt. “I think people's image of a catastrophic unwind is wrong, even in a bad scenario. A slow, partial unwind is what would actually happen,” Hougan said.

Source: SEC In the context of the already approved spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in-kind redemptions allow investors to receive the underlying assets, such as Bitcoin or Ether, instead of cash when redeeming shares. This method is generally considered more efficient, as it enables the fund’s authorized participants to avoid selling the assets on the market, potentially reducing transaction costs. Related: SEC delays in-kind redemption decision for Bitwise crypto ETFs Regulatory momentum builds around crypto ETFs and policy reform When the SEC approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in 2024 , it only allowed cash redemptions, withholding approval for in-kind creations and redemptions. Since then, momentum has steadily shifted toward embracing in-kind mechanisms. At the Bitcoin Policy Institute conference last month, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce acknowledged the growing interest in permitting in-kind redemptions. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told the Bitcoin Policy Institute conference last month that in-kind redemptions for crypto funds may be approved soon. Source: Bitcoin Policy Institute This shift reflects a broader industry trend toward more pro-crypto policy, largely driven by the Trump administration’s commitment to supporting the sector’s growth. The movement gained further traction earlier this month when Congress passed three significant crypto-related bills addressing market structure, stablecoins and the prevention of a surveillance-oriented central bank digital currency. Amid the broader pro-industry policy shift, demand for crypto ETFs continues to grow. As Cointelegraph reported , US spot Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded a 12-day streak of inflows, bringing in $6.6 billion in assets. Collectively, US Bitcoin ETFs now hold more than 1.298 million BTC, valued at approximately $152.1 billion, according to Bitbo data . Momentum is also building around Ether ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF recently surpassed $10 billion in assets in just 251 days, making it the third-fastest fund to reach that milestone.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Senate Agriculture Committee has pulled a planned hearing on Brian Quintenz’s nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), following a request from the White House just days before lawmakers leave for August recess. In an update to the committee’s schedule on Monday, chair John Boozman and ranking member Amy Klobuchar said lawmakers would not consider Brian Quintenz’s nomination to chair the CFTC. A spokesperson for the committee told Cointelegraph that consideration of Quintenz’s nomination was removed following a request from the White House. Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. The agriculture committee had been scheduled to consider Donald Trump’s pick to lead the financial regulator before going on recess on Aug. 4. The delay marked the second time the agriculture committee pushed voting on Quintenz’s nomination — the body was also scheduled to consider the prospective CFTC chair’s nomination in a July 21 meeting. As of Tuesday, it was unclear whether the Senate would address Quintenz’s nomination before or after going on recess. Related: Trump’s CFTC chair pick won’t push president for bipartisan commission Quintenz served as a CFTC commissioner under Trump from 2017 to 2021, having been nominated by former US President Barack Obama in 2016. He has also faced questions from lawmakers in a June Senate Agriculture Committee hearing and reportedly disclosed about $3.4 million in assets. Will a crypto-friendly CFTC join the SEC? Quintenz’s nomination is significant as the Senate is expected to move forward with a bill to clarify the roles the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would have in overseeing digital assets after returning in September. After Trump took office and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler departed, the securities regulator dropped investigations and lawsuits against several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Kraken. Whoever heads the CFTC could likewise have influence over policy affecting the digital asset industry. The CFTC still faces an exodus of regulators Quintenz’s potential confirmation to lead the CFTC could come as commissioners prepare to leave multiple vacancies at the US financial regulator. Three members of the commission’s five-seat panel, former chair Rostin Behnam and Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero, departed earlier this year. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said she planned to move to the private sector if Quintenz were nominated, and Kristin Johnson said she would leave before 2026. As of July, Trump had not announced any potential replacements for the four seats expected to be vacant after the Senate considers Quintenz’s nomination.

Corporations are buying Ether at a faster pace than Bitcoin, signaling a shift in institutional interest toward the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency as it prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary, according to a new report from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph. The 10 largest corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms have bought up 1% of the total Ether ( ETH ) supply since the beginning of June, the bank said in a Tuesday research report. Over the same period, Ether-focused treasury firms have doubled the pace of investments compared to their Bitcoin ( BTC )-focused counterparts, helping ETH outperform Bitcoin’s price action, the report said. The report attributed some of Ether’s recent price strength to this accumulation trend and the performance of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), writing: “Buying by these companies, along with the best period for ETH ETFs on record, has certainly contributed to those gains.” Standard Chartered added that continued inflows could push ETH above its $4,000 year-end forecast.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the special administrative region’s central banking authority, has finalized its regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, releasing two sets of guidelines that will take effect on Aug. 1. On Tuesday, the HKMA released completed guidelines and consultation conclusions to clarify the upcoming rules. The documents addressed the supervision of licensed stablecoin issuers and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) rules for licensed stablecoin issuers. Alongside the finalized rules, Hong Kong will launch a public registry of licensed issuers as part of a broader push to bring oversight to the local crypto ecosystem. “In the future, the public may refer to the register of licensed stablecoin issuers as shown on the HKMA’s website,” the regulator said. HKMA says no licenses issued yet “As of today, no licence has been issued by the HKMA,” the regulator said, warning the public to stay vigilant and wary of people or entities that claim to be regulated or licensed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong. The HKMA also warned the public of those who claim to be applying for a license. “Members of the public who hold unlicensed stablecoins are at their own risk,” the HKMA said. On Thursday, HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said stablecoin hype led to unjustified trading volume and stock price surges. He said that it appeared to be necessary to “rein in the euphoria,” clarifying that many applying for stablecoin licenses fall short of the regulator’s standards. Yue said some proposals were vague and lacked realistic implementation. He added that some groups that applied lacked the technical expertise to be stablecoin issuers. Yue said only a few licenses will be issued initially as the new regulatory framework takes effect. He also warned investors to steer clear of unlicensed stablecoin offerings to avoid breaking the upcoming law. The HKMA has encouraged market participants interested in applying for a stablecoin license to approach the regulator by Aug. 1. The central bank said applicants must also submit their full applications by Sept. 30 to be considered in the first batch of licensees.

As a result, ETH is now up 110% to $3,800 over the last three months, while many of its competitors have made modest double-digit gains, CoinGecko data shows. “What we’re seeing is institutional FOMO at scale — major players racing to establish dominant positions before potential ETF approvals create even more demand pressure,” crypto cybersecurity analyst Wilson Ye posted to X on Monday. “This competition actually validates the thesis that ETH is becoming institutionalized infrastructure,” Ye added. 🟢 BREAKING SΞR NEWS: Bitmine Immersion Technology $BMNR purchases 137,515 ETH and overtakes SharpLink Gaming to become the #1 holder in the SΞR with a massive 300,657 ETH.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Nasdaq-listed Mill City Ventures III has completed a major $450 million private placement to pivot its business strategy toward cryptocurrency with a Sui treasury. The non-bank lender and specialty finance company announced on Monday that it has raised approximately $450 million by selling 83 million shares to institutional investors. The offering includes investment from Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, ParaFi Capital, Arrington Capital, FalconX and other venture firms. Galaxy Asset Management will serve as the treasury asset manager. The firm plans to use 98% of the proceeds to acquire Sui ( SUI ) tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the layer-1 Sui blockchain, as its primary treasury asset, while maintaining 2% for its existing short-term lending business. Mill City claims that this is an “industry-first” relationship with the Sui Foundation and the first public company SUI treasury. Why invest in Sui? Commenting on why Sui was selected for the firm’s pivot to crypto, incoming chief investment officer Stephen Mackintosh said it was at a time when “crypto and AI are reaching critical mass.” “We believe that Sui is well-positioned for mass adoption with the speed and efficiency institutions require for crypto at scale, plus the technical architecture capable of supporting AI workloads while maintaining security and decentralization,” he added.

The company plans to bolster its BNB holdings over the next two years through at-the-market offerings and “other proven strategies.” It will also look to make revenue from its holdings through staking and lending. Several public companies have pivoted to stockpiling crypto this year. In some cases, the announcements have boosted the value of the company and the crypto token it’s buying. BNB mostly held by Zhao, Binance Zhao revealed in February that 98.5% of his crypto portfolio was BNB, without specifying the total value of his holdings. Forbes reported in June 2024 that Zhao and Binance together controlled what was then 71% of the BNB tokens in circulation. Binance is deeply tied to BNB, as it launched the token and the BNB Chain in 2017, and still offers perks to BNB holders on its platform. While the exchange is not involved in developing the token or the blockchain, some investors could see BNB as a way to indirectly gain exposure to the Binance ecosystem. Zhao is banned from managing Binance as part of a deal with the US to plead guilty to money laundering violations, but he is still the exchange’s biggest shareholder.

TuongVy Le, who spent nearly six years at the SEC as chief counsel and senior adviser in the Enforcement Division and the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, has joined Veda as general counsel, the company announced Tuesday. During her SEC tenure, Le advised Congress on early drafts of digital asset legislation and served on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee.

She served in the SEC’s Enforcement Division from 2016 to 2021 — a pivotal period in the agency’s crackdown on unregistered securities offerings tied to initial coin offerings (ICOs). During that time, the SEC brought actions against the promoters of BitConnect’s lending program and against LBRY , alleging both conducted unregistered securities offerings. In 2021, the agency also initiated one of its earliest DeFi-related enforcement actions, charging Blockchain Credit Partners with securities fraud. Before joining Veda, Le was general counsel and corporate secretary at Anchorage Digital, a crypto custody platform, before moving into an advisory role. “What drew me to crypto was the chance to help build a financial system that’s more transparent, programmable and accessible from the ground up,” Le told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “When I learned about blockchain technology, it was clear this wasn’t just a new asset class — it was a chance to reimagine how markets work.” She added: “My experience in TradFi, the SEC, and across the crypto industry helps me bridge multiple worlds: bringing regulatory rigor to crypto while also helping policymakers understand what’s genuinely new and valuable here.” The appointment of Le came one month after Veda secured $18 million in funding from several venture capital investors, including Coinbase Ventures, CoinFund and Animoca Ventures.

Dalio said he has “some Bitcoin, but not much,” and is still “strongly preferring gold to Bitcoin,” however. But the exact split between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold “is up to you,” Dalio said. His 15% suggestion marks a sharp increase from the 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation he recommended in January 2022. Source: Cointelegraph Dalio’s comments were made in the context of America’s national debt crisis, which has ballooned to $36.7 trillion, US Treasury data shows. “The issue is the devaluation of money,” Dalio said while pointing out that the US government will likely need to issue another $12 trillion worth of Treasurys over the next year to service its mounting debt. Latest US Treasury report reflects Dalio’s point A US Treasury report released on Monday projected another $1 trillion in new borrowing in the third quarter — $453 billion more than previously estimated — due to weaker cash flows and lower reserves. The Treasury also expects to borrow $590 billion in Q4, adding to the US government’s growing reliance on debt to fund budget expenses and worsening concerns about its future fiscal path.

The agency also postponed decisions on Grayscale’s Solana Trust , extended to Oct. 10, and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF. Hester Peirce, a commissioner on the SEC — dubbed “Crypto Mom” for her pro-crypto stance — recently urged industry stakeholders to expect slower approvals. “People have to be patient… We have some ongoing litigation we’re trying to work through. We have lots of other considerations,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg in May. Still, today’s delays are swift by historical standards.

Questions over Trump’s ETF If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would be the first crypto ETF linked to a sitting US president’s business interests. While the ETF itself hasn’t drawn formal objections from the SEC, other Trump-linked crypto deals have raised questions about ethics, influence, and regulatory impartiality, especially among Democrats. In May, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley sent a formal letter to the Office of Government Ethics, calling a Trump-linked crypto deal involving World Liberty Financial, Binance and a United Arab Emirates (UAE) firm “a staggering conflict of interest.” They wrote, This deal raises the troubling prospect that the Trump and Witkoff families could expand the use of their stablecoin as an avenue to profit from foreign corruption.” There is also concern that Trump could personally benefit from regulatory decisions that impact crypto markets or firms connected to his business ventures, especially if the SEC approves a financial product that legitimizes or increases demand for assets linked to his brand. Trump has actively engaged with the crypto industry since he took office. On July 18, he signed the GENIUS Act , the first major US law to provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 29, 4:00 pm UTC): This article has been updated following communication from the ECB. A previous update added context on stablecoin oversight. An adviser to the European Central Bank (ECB) has called for global coordination in regulating stablecoins to prevent the US dollar dominance. In a blog post published Monday on the ECB’s website, adviser Jürgen Schaaf outlined a range of strategic options for the European Union to address the rapid rise of dollar-based stablecoins. Among those options were regulated euro-pegged stablecoins, distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications and the ongoing development of the digital euro. He also highlighted the implications of stablecoin regulation disparities between the US GENIUS Act and the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, arguing that regulatory gaps could be beneficial to US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Euro-based stablecoins as the first lever “First, more support could be provided for properly regulated euro-denominated stablecoins,” Schaaf wrote, suggesting that stablecoins would be the EU’s primary response to the US stablecoin push. “While the neutrality of public institutions is often preferred, a strategic blind spot in this space could prove costly,” Schaaf said, adding: “Euro-based stablecoins, if designed to high standards and effective risk mitigation, could serve legitimate market needs. They could also reinforce the international role of the euro.” Some studies previously highlighted the slow adoption rate of Europe-based stablecoins. In May, Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta, a former ECB official, said the circulation of euro-pegged stablecoins remained limited despite frameworks like MiCA attempting to promote their use. Related: Euro stablecoin by DWS and Deutsche Bank gets regulatory approval Panetta also argued that the digital euro would be key to addressing the issue of the slow adoption of euro stablecoins. ECB looks beyond digital euro Schaaf, however, framed the digital euro as just one part of a larger digital payments strategy. He said a public central bank digital currency (CBDC) , along with private innovation and DLT applications, can act as complementary pillars in safeguarding European monetary sovereignty. “In point-of-interaction payments, the digital euro promises to be a robust line of defence of European monetary sovereignty,” he said. Related: Shanghai officials warm to stablecoins despite China crypto ban: Report While not expanding on the digital euro, Schaaf focused on the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) as another option, saying that the technology offers improvements for domestic wholesale payments and cross-border payments. An excerpt from the ECB’s announcement on approving Pontes and Appia projects on July 1. Source: ECB In early July, the ECB approved two DLT pilot projects — Pontes and Appia — aimed at strengthening Europe’s wholesale and cross-border payment infrastructure. Regulatory gaps empower the dollar In his assessment of how the EU might respond to the growing US stablecoin presence, ECB adviser Schaaf underscored the importance of unified global standards to avoid market fragmentation and regulatory loopholes. “Stronger global coordination on stablecoin regulation is pivotal,” the ECB adviser wrote, adding: ‘Without consistent rules, the current fragmentation may persist. If we forgo a common approach, we risk fuelling instability, regulatory arbitrage and global US dollar dominance.” Schaaf said that the US Genius Act — a stablecoin bill signed into law on July 18 — is “broadly in line” with the EU’s MiCA framework, but more lenient in some areas. When approached by Cointelegraph, Schaaf declined to specify which aspects of the US stablecoin regulation he considered less strict or how these regulatory differences might be resolved. EU to decide on the digital euro in 2025 The latest remarks by Schaaf bring fresh evidence that Europe is considering a multi-pronged approach to respond to the US stablecoin leadership rather than focusing on just one initiative, such as the digital euro. Europe became concerned about US leadership in digital financial technology soon after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pledging to strengthen the US dollar’s sovereignty by promoting stablecoins in January. ECB President Christine Lagarde pushed the digital euro project at a press conference in July. Source: ECB ECB officials have repeatedly approached the issue since, with board member Piero Cipollone arguing that the digital euro could help the EU preserve the eurozone’s monetary sovereignty. After moving the digital euro to the “preparation phase” in November 2023, ECB officials have yet to decide on whether to move forward with its launch. According to the ECB, the ECB Governing Council will decide whether to move on to the next phase of preparations by the end of 2025.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto exchange Coinbase is launching a developer tool aimed at simplifying wallet onboarding and boosting technical capabilities, as self-custody gains momentum in the United States following the passage of pro-crypto legislation earlier this month. Offered through the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), the Embedded Wallets tool gives developers access to the same infrastructure that will power Coinbase’s forthcoming decentralized exchange, the company disclosed Tuesday. The toolkit offers native rewards in USDC ( USDC ), the stablecoin issued by Circle. Users can earn 4.1% APY on USDC balances held within the wallets, without requiring staking. According to the Coinbase Developer Platform, this APY can either be retained by developers or passed on to users. The new developer tool is being targeted at developers across decentralized finance (DeFi) , gaming, payments and Web3 social media sectors. It arrives as Coinbase has rebranded its own wallet into an “everything app,” now called the Base app after its layer-2 network.

The CLARITY Act establishes a regulatory framework for the digital asset economy while guaranteeing self-custody rights , allowing users to hold cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. The legislation also recognizes the role of self-custody in enabling DeFi and peer-to-peer transactions, which are core pillars of crypto. The House of Representatives passed the CLARITY Act before their August recess.

Industry insiders say favorable stablecoin regulations could drive more value onchain by enabling the tokenization of real-world assets. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph , Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at digital asset bank Sygnum, said the GENIUS Act paves the way for innovations in financial services beyond stablecoins. “By providing long-sought-after clarity, it gives confidence to organizations and issuers to develop original, innovative ‘killer apps’ that don’t just serve their customers’ current needs, but create demand for entirely new services, including payments,” Dori said.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED An early Bitcoin ( BTC ) investor has sold 80,000 BTC through Galaxy Digital, in what the digital asset company described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history, though details regarding the date and execution price were not disclosed. Galaxy Digital’s disclosure of the sale first appeared on PR Newswire late Friday, followed by a post on the company’s official blog about 30 minutes later. Cointelegraph reached out to Galaxy Digital for further details on the transaction, and although the company declined to comment further, they did confirm the authenticity of the press release. Galaxy did not reveal the client’s identity but stated that the “transaction was part of the investor’s broader real estate planning strategy.” The announcement came on a day of heightened volatility for Bitcoin, with the price briefly dipping below $115,000 on Friday, according to Cointelegraph.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The tokenization of money market funds marks a significant step in preserving the appeal of “cash as an asset,” especially as the growing adoption of stablecoins threatens to erode the attractiveness of traditional fund offerings, according to JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho. Commenting on recent initiatives by Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon to tokenize shares of money market funds , Ho noted that such services will help maintain the competitiveness of these funds while unlocking new use cases, such as margin collateral. This development is particularly timely given the recent passage of the US GENIUS Act , a comprehensive stablecoin bill expected to accelerate the usage of digital dollars by integrating the speed and predictability of blockchain technology into the traditional banking system. Competition in this space is expected to intensify, JPMorgan strategists said. In an interview with Bloomberg , Ho emphasized that the Goldman-BNY tokenization effort underscores how money market funds can evolve: “Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasurys, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds.” The banking industry has been closely monitoring the rise of stablecoins amid concerns that they could erode demand for traditional assets. In April, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee — an industry group that advises the US government — warned that stablecoins could reduce banks’ demand for Treasury bonds, potentially affecting credit growth. Money market funds, which invest in short-term debt securities such as Treasury bills, could be directly impacted. Before the passage of the GENIUS Act, money market expert and Crane Data President Peter Crane noted that the sector was closely watching the stablecoin market for its potential impact on Treasury market liquidity. He concluded, however, that such liquidity concerns were likely overstated unless the stablecoin market expands significantly. Nevertheless, State Street Global Advisors President and CEO Yie-Hsin Hung told a conference last month that “cash will lose its crown” if Wall Street is too slow to join the tokenization trend.

Michael Sonnenshein, president of tokenization firm Securitize, told The Wall Street Journal that the GENIUS Act will pave the way for more companies to embrace tokenization without fear of regulatory backlash. “For any of the asset issuers that have perhaps been on the sidelines or have been hesitant to go full force into the world of tokenized securities, this now offers them a little bit of additional air cover,” he said . The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), particularly private credit and US Treasury bonds , has become one of blockchain’s most prominent use cases this year. Excluding stablecoins, tokenized RWAs have grown into a $25 billion market across 256 issuers, according to industry data. The RWA market is broken down by asset class.

After holding their stash since 2011, the Satoshi-era whale , or large cryptocurrency investor, first transferred 40,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth over $4.6 billion on July 15, followed by a second transaction of 40,000 BTC on July 18 to Galaxy Digital, Cointelegraph previously reported. According to blockchain intelligence platform Lookonchain, Galaxy Digital has since moved more than 10,000 BTC — worth about $1.18 billion — to major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Bitstamp, Coinbase and OKX. “The 10,000+ $BTC comes from the Bitcoin OG holding 80,009 $BTC($9.68B),” Lookonchain said on X. Source: Lookonchain The whale’s multibillion-dollar transfers, paired with the new auditing requirements enforced by the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act , have sparked concerns among industry watchers over a potential Bitcoin correction . “That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in financial history: Bitcoin. It’s entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,” said Jacob King, financial analyst and the CEO of WhaleWire, in a July 18 X post . Related: Strategy launches Bitcoin stock pegged at $100 to increase treasury Yet from a historical perspective, “dormant whale movements have not consistently preceded significant market corrections,” analysts from Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph, adding: “This whale movement, although eye-catching, should not overshadow the constructive momentum the crypto industry is gaining on the regulatory front.” Long-term whales “re-engaging with the network” may signal a broader shift toward “readiness for the next institutional cycle,” instead of a bearish pivot, the analysts said. Whale’s sale may be absorbed Despite concerns over a wider correction, some industry watchers said that the $9.6 billion Bitcoin sale may all be absorbed by the cryptocurrency market. Onchain analyst EmberCN said on X that about 12,000 BTC, or $1.38 billion, remain to be sold. He added that the whale is likely unloading the assets via a combination of over-the-counter (OTC) and secondary market sales: “This means that the [80,000 BTC ancient whale] likely has about 12,000 BTC ($1.38 billion) yet to be sold, and with the current market liquidity, absorbing the remaining portion of these coins should not have a significant impact.” Related: Bitcoin becomes 5th global asset ahead of “Crypto Week,” flips Amazon: Finance Redefined Some industry watchers suggest the moves reflect a deeper shift in crypto market structure.

This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales,” said Ju in a Friday X post , adding: “Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought. Trading feels pointless. Holders now outnumber traders.” Other crypto analysts have also pointed to the launch of the US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the growing institutional investments as a disruptor for the traditional four-year Bitcoin cycle theory. Moreover, the growing institutional investment from firms such as Strategy , Tether and Metaplanet may accelerate Bitcoin’s traditional cycle and reach new all-time highs, Vugar Usi Zade, chief operating officer at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph.

In just seven days, the sector added nearly $4 billion, pushing the stablecoin market cap above $264 billion and fueling corporate interest in related ventures. The surge is no surprise. The landmark legislation provides banks, asset managers, and other institutional investors with a federal framework for fiat-backed stablecoins without the looming threat of enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With regulatory clarity comes new capital, new players, and intensified competition. Signs of this shift had already emerged even before the GENIUS Act was enacted.

Source: DefiLlama In a May interview with Yahoo Finance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was asked if he was concerned about banks entering the stablecoin market. “No,” he replied. “I think everybody should be able to create stablecoins.” Traditional finance seems to agree, and with new entrants pouring in, attention is shifting to stablecoin design and the institutions behind them. Related: Franklin Templeton to bring BENJI platform to VeChain for enterprise payments Not all stablecoins are created equal While all stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, they can differ significantly in how they achieve that stability. These tokens generally fall into four categories: fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic, and commodity-backed. Fiat-backed stablecoins are the most common, pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, and backed by cash or short-term assets, like US Treasurys. At the time of writing, they make up roughly 85% of the stablecoin market. The GENIUS Act specifically targeted this type of stablecoin. The largest fiat-backed stablecoins are USDt ( USDT ) by Tether and USDC ( USDC ) by Circle, with a combined market capitalization of over $227 billion. Under the GENIUS Act, compliant fiat-backed issuers must hold full reserves, undergo audits, and be appropriately licensed. Crypto-backed stablecoins are tokens overcollateralized with crypto assets like ETH or tokenized Bitcoin. The leading example is DAI (formerly MakerDAO), which is backed by a mix of crypto collateral and holds a market cap of around $4.35 billion, according to DefiLlama. The final two categories are minor but noteworthy. Algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg by automatically adjusting supply, but they’ve proven fragile, most notably with the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Algorithmic stablecoins are sidelined under the GENIUS Act and slated for separate treatment. Commodity-backed stablecoins, like Pax Gold ( PAXG ), are backed by commodities such as gold and could be used as an inflation hedge, though adoption remains limited due to liquidity and custodial complexity.

The company expects all committed funds to arrive within the next two weeks. If the full amount is converted into Bitcoin, the purchase would make Satsuma the second-largest corporate Bitcoin ( BTC ) holder in the UK, behind The Smarter Web Company, which holds 1,600 BTC worth about $190 million, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data. Currently, Phoenix Digital Assets holds second place with 247 BTC valued at $29 million. The planned acquisition may also mark the largest single Bitcoin purchase by a UK company, as The Smarter Web accumulated its holdings through multiple transactions.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Hong Kong will start enforcing its Stablecoin Ordinance on Aug. 1, making it illegal to offer or promote unlicensed fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS) to retail investors. The new law introduces criminal penalties of up to a level five fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $6,300) and a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the special administrative region’s central bank, issued a public warning on Wednesday, urging investors to steer clear of unlicensed offerings to avoid inadvertently breaking the law. HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said in the warning that the upcoming regulation aims to bring credibility and stability to the budding stablecoin sector while safeguarding investors from fraud and excessive speculation. Excerpt from Hong Kong’s upcoming Stablecoin Ordinance. Source: Hong Kong government Hong Kong reins in the stablecoin “euphoria” Yue said a market frenzy fueled by hype surrounding stablecoin announcements led to unjustified stock prices and trading volume spikes. “It seems necessary to further rein in the euphoria,” Yue wrote in the Wednesday announcement. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that there were as many as 50 companies applying for stablecoin licenses. In June, Guotai Junan shares jumped 300% after its banking license was extended to include digital assets. Yue said that while many institutions approached the central bank to express interest in getting a stablecoin license, many proposals were vague, conceptual and lacked realistic implementation plans. “They also fail to put together viable and concrete plans as well as implementation roadmaps, let alone demonstrate their awareness of risks and competence in managing them,” Yue said. He added that while some provide viable use cases, some lack the technical expertise to issue stablecoins and capabilities in managing financial risks. Because of these, Yue said only a handful of licenses will be initially granted, while most applicants should not expect approvals.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump overcame internal party divisions to push three crypto bills through the House of Representatives last week, though some still face hurdles before becoming law. After two long sessions in the House last week, on Thursday all but 12 Republicans and more than 100 Democrats voted yay on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins, which Trump signed into law about 24 hours later. The other two bills, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act and the Anti-CBDC (central bank digital currency) Surveillance State Act, will head to the Senate for consideration as both chambers prepare to break for an August recess. The three bills were part of Republicans’ “crypto week” initiative, claiming urgency in establishing regulatory clarity for aspects of the digital asset industry. Some Republican lawmakers have attempted to brand their efforts as “non-partisan” or bipartisan. The overwhelming majority of spectators at the GENIUS Act signing were members of their party or otherwise allied with Trump, while some Democrats continue to bring up Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in debates over bills connected to his own crypto ventures. This suggested that the legislation could still face arguments from Senate Democrats over the remaining two bills. Senate Republicans are expected to address crypto market structure first. The bill would lay out rules for regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and distinguish which tokens qualified as securities under US law. Related: Crypto execs to attend US stablecoin bill signing after Thursday vote CLARITY comes first, and CBDCs second? On Tuesday, four Republican senators released a discussion draft of their version of a crypto market structure bill, which they said “builds on” the CLARITY Act. The legislation, tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, suggested that the House’s efforts to establish crypto market structure may have been little more than a test run for the Senate’s bill. Whether the CLARITY Act or the Responsible Financial Innovation Act ends up being closer to the final product desired by Republicans, either bill must pass through both chambers to wind up on Trump’s desk. The anti-CBDC bill faces similar challenges. Only two Democrats sided with Republicans to approve the bill in the House. Reports also suggested that many Republicans held up the initial vote on all three bills over concerns that the wording of the GENIUS Act could allow for a backdoor to a US digital dollar. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, chair of the banking committee’s digital assets subcommittee, has also proposed that the Senate remain in session through August to address some of Trump’s nominations. A spokesperson for the senator said she would also help “execute the president’s agenda” during that time, signaling that she could also use the time to prepare for markups on the two bills. The CFTC still faces staffing issues Amid all the discussions on the crypto bills and with lawmakers in Congress expected to break for their August recess in a matter of days, the Senate also has yet to vote on the nomination of Brian Quintenz to chair the CFTC. Reports suggested that one Republican senator had been absent from a scheduled Monday committee meeting, forcing leadership to delay a vote on Quintenz. A spokesperson for Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman, meeting to consider Quintenz’s nomination, told Cointelegraph Republicans expected a vote along party lines. However, the committee planned to vote on the prospective CFTC chair before the August recess. Only two commissioners, acting chair Caroline Pham and Kristin Johnson, were serving at the CFTC at the time of publication. Both are expected to depart the agency before 2026 after Quintenz’s possible confirmation by the Senate, potentially leaving four leadership seats vacant.

Alternatively, Johnsson speculated that the pause might be a plan by the SEC, now chaired by Paul Atkins, to get around the 240-day statutory period for final approval. “Both explanations are the kind of funny business that shouldn’t really be happening under Atkins.” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he thinks the SEC might be stalling until the agency comes up with a listing standard for crypto ETFs.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED SSK, the Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) from REX-Osprey, surpassed $100 million in assets under management (AUM) since its launch on July 2. The fund is the first US-listed ETF to combine spot Solana ( SOL ) exposure with onchain staking rewards. While most crypto ETFs are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which doesn’t allow funds to distribute staking rewards, SSK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. That structure permits the fund to pay out staking income like dividends, important to investors seeking yield, not just speculation on asset prices. According to Rex-Opsprey founder and CEO REX -Osprey Greg King, the ETF’s growth shows investor demand for blockchain-native investment products in familiar formats. In a press release, he said SSK is “opening the door for mainstream investors to access the power of Solana staking through the familiar ETF wrapper.” SOL traded above $200 per coin today and is up 25.3% over the last seven days, according to data from CoinGecko . Speaking with Cointelegraph, King said REX-Osprey aims to expand its ETF lineup to meet client demand. “We’ve also filed for similarly structured ETFs on XRP, DOGE, and ETH. And we’re looking at many more cryptos beyond those.” He says the product “appeals to registered investment advisers (RIAs) and others who want both exposure to Solana and to receive monthly distributions in an entirely new way from the current ways of generating income.” Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs break 12-day inflow streak amid ‘profit taking’ Institutions shift toward staking income SSK’s Solana fund is part of a broader trend: Institutional investors are warming to staking-based returns as an alternative or supplement to traditional fixed income.

In addition to SSK, platforms offering Ethereum staking and tokenized US Treasury products have seen steady inflows from institutional allocators. While staking ETFs face regulatory hurdles, SSK’s debut could set a precedent for upcoming funds.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Republican leaders on the US Senate Banking Committee have released their version of legislation for a digital asset market structure, suggesting they may be combining their efforts with a bill passed in the House of Representatives. In a Tuesday notice, four Republican senators, including banking committee chair Tim Scott and digital assets subcommittee chair Cynthia Lummis, released a discussion draft of crypto market structure legislation. According to lawmakers, the tentatively titled Responsible Financial Innovation Act “builds on” the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which was passed in the House on July 17. “My colleagues in the House and Senate and I share the same goal: provide clear rules of the road for digital assets,” said Scott. Though Republicans in the House pushed through three crypto bills with bipartisan support last week, only the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act had passed through both chambers and was able to be signed into law by US President Donald Trump. Scott and Lummis said in June that they planned to have the market structure bill passed by the Senate before October. Related: Many senators absent from ‘bipartisan’ crypto market structure hearing Side-by-side look at the Senate and House bills Both chambers’ versions of the crypto market structure legislation proposed amending disclosure requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, implying that existing laws were unsuitable for regulating modern investment vehicles such as digital assets. The CLARITY Act appeared to allow for more collaboration between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in establishing rules for digital asset transactions. The Senate’s draft bill also included amendments related to disclosures of “ancillary assets,” which lawmakers said applied to digital assets that were not considered securities. “With bipartisan backing, the CLARITY Act heading to the Senate signals increasing momentum behind comprehensive crypto policy and growing alignment on the need for market structure rules, even if full passage may take longer as Congress breaks for the summer,” said Liat Shetre, Elliptic’s vice president of global policy and regulation, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. It’s unclear whether the draft bill will have enough support to pass in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority over Democrats.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED SpaceX has moved 1,308 Bitcoin, worth approximately $153 million, in its first onchain activity in three years. The movement was flagged by Arkham Intelligence, which tracks wallets tied to the company. The Bitcoin ( BTC ) was withdrawn from 16 Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses and consolidated into a single SegWit-compatible Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) address, where it remained at time of publication. The movement of BTC from 16 separate addresses into one could make it easier to manage and possibly cheaper to spend the funds later. While the reason for moving the assets is unclear, the nature of the transfer suggests a strategic adjustment rather than a reactive action. SpaceX is a private aerospace company founded by Elon Musk in 2002. The company first disclosed its BTC holdings in July 2021, alongside Tesla. The purchase was part of Musk’s broader strategy to diversify his companies’ assets and support crypto adoption. Source: Arkham Intelligence Neither SpaceX nor Musk has commented on the transfer. Contract tensions grow as Pentagon eyes SpaceX alternatives SpaceX’s decision to consolidate its Bitcoin holdings comes as the company is navigating increasing political uncertainty. In early June, the administration of US President Donald Trump reportedly threatened to review or cancel about $22 billion in SpaceX contracts amid a feud between the Trump and Musk on X. Though most of the contracts were deemed “too critical to US interests to eliminate,” the episode signaled growing political tension and raised questions about SpaceX’s long-term standing with the US government. Today, the Pentagon announced its decision to diversify its partners for the Golden Dome missile defense system, a $175 billion missile defense initiative to build a space-based network of satellites to detect and track incoming threats. Reported by Reuters , concerns over “over-reliance on SpaceX” have prompted the Trump administration to open bids to other providers, ensuring the Golden Dome isn’t solely dependent on SpaceX.

His early tweets endorsing Dogecoin sent the memecoin soaring, only for it to crash by 30% following his appearance on the TV sketch comedy show “Saturday Night Live.” That same year, Tesla announced a $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase and briefly accepted BTC as payment. The decision was soon reversed over environmental concerns , and a portion of the company’s holdings was sold off. After acquiring Twitter in 2022 and rebranding it as X, Musk began laying the groundwork for a broader financial ecosystem . X secured money transmitter licenses across the US, and backend code revealed early development of a native crypto wallet . While no crypto features have been launched publicly, blockchain integration remains part of the long-term vision. In a 2024 podcast, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said SpaceX uses stablecoins to collect Starlink payments in emerging markets , bypassing traditional banking rails. “They don’t want to deal with sending wires… so they swap into stablecoins,” he said. Today, SpaceX is estimated to hold about 6,977 BTC, worth approximately $815 million, positioning it quietly among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly ended its investigation of Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell and returned property belonging to him that was seized in a 2023 search of his home. According to a Tuesday Fortune report, the FBI had returned devices to Powell and ended its probe over allegations he had hacked and cyberstalked the Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit he helped found in 2008. The investigation, reportedly not connected to Powell’s association with Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded, or the crypto industry, resulted in the FBI searching his home and seizing electronic devices that could have contained digital assets. Reports suggested that Powell had been under investigation by US authorities since 2022. The Kraken co-founder repeatedly denied involvement in the alleged activities and filed a civil suit against members of Verge’s board of directors. Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED JPMorgan Chase is reportedly looking into crypto-backed loans, signaling a potential shift in how US banks regard crypto assets. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources, that JPMorgan may start lending directly against crypto assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ). The FT reported this may happen by 2026, though the plans are subject to change. The report followed a recent JPMorgan indication that it is interested in stablecoins . In a July 15 earnings call, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said they plan to be involved in stablecoins. He said the bank will be involved in the asset class to “understand it” and “be good at it.” The comments came as its competitor Citigroup announced plans to enter the stablecoin race. In a post-earnings conference call, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said the bank was considering issuing a stablecoin for payments. Cointelegraph reached out to JPMorgan for comments but had not received a response by publication. JPMorgan CEO softens stance on crypto In previous years, Dimon had expressed anti-crypto sentiments. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud” during a company meeting, saying that he would fire any employee trading BTC on the company’s accounts. In 2018, Dimon criticized crypto during an event, calling it a “scam” and saying he had no interest in it . In 2022, Dimon made more anti-crypto remarks, calling digital assets “decentralized Ponzi schemes.” Despite this, he commented positively on blockchain , decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts and “tokens that do something.” According to the Financial Times report, the unidentified source said that Dimon’s earlier anti-Bitcoin comments had alienated potential clients who made their money through crypto or were long-term believers in the asset class.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED US House Republicans are seeking to cut the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2026 budget by 7%, while axing funds for enforcing a Biden-era rule that requires public companies to disclose cyber incidents. A House Appropriations subcommittee voted to move forward a $23.3 billion funding plan on Monday, laying out proposed fiscal year 2026 budgets for multiple agencies including the SEC and Treasury. The plan would see the overall budget cut by nearly 8%, or around $410 million, compared to fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30. The subcommittee’s chair, Dave Joyce, claimed the measure would help with “reining in wasteful spending.” Source: Dave Joyce The move reads as the GOP’s latest bid to unwind many of the rules — including those impacting crypto made by the SEC under former President Joe Biden’s administration. The Financial Services subcommittee voted down party lines on Monday to report the plan to the full House Appropriations Committee. SEC budget cut 7% with spending bans under GOP plan The plan would give the SEC just over $2.03 billion for 2026, a 7% cut — or $153.9 million less — than its budget in fiscal year 2025. It would also slap on a range of restrictions banning what the funds can be spent on, one of which prohibits the money being used to enforce rules adopted in mid-2023 that require companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents under a strict time limit. Under the rule, a public company and foreign private issuers must disclose a cyberattack within four days, unless it would be deemed a possible national security or public safety risk. They also must disclose their cyber risk management strategies yearly. The proposed budget is less than what the SEC asked for last month, when the agency requested $2.149 billion to support 4,101 full-time staff. Banking groups urged SEC to kill rule In May, a group of banking advocacy groups asked the SEC to kill the cyber disclosure rule , arguing it had been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives.” The rule has impacted Coinbase, which disclosed in May that some of its customer support contractors were bribed to leak its users’ data, which saw the crypto exchange hit with a flurry of lawsuits. Related: SEC explores Ethereum token standard for compliant securities Coinbase said it rejected a $20 million ransom demand amid the leaks, which it estimated could cost up to $400 million in damages. Democrats push back on Republican funding plan The Republican-led budget plan would also restrict the SEC from using funds to collect personally identifiable information through a long-standing system to track equity and options trading activity. Among other provisions, the funds will also be restricted from being used to make new rules governing private securities offerings. House Appropriations Democrats said on X that the plan is a “blow to everyday Americans” that allows corporations to “skirt the law and hoard even more wealth.” Committee Ranking member Rosa DeLauro said the plan would let “greedy corporations cheat on their taxes, poison consumers, [and] continue to scam everyday Americans out of their hard-earned money.” Source: Rosa DeLauro Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered # Business # SEC # Cybercrime # Cybersecurity # Regulation Add reaction","Jesse Coghlan Jul 22, 2025 Republicans propose 7% leaner SEC budget compared to Biden’s era House Republicans have proposed a plan to trim the SEC’s budget and cut enforcement funding for a Biden-era rule requiring public companies to quickly report cyberattacks.",CoinTelegraph,2025-07-22 06:05:17+00:00,2025-12-07 14:11:34.101708,2025-12-07T19:20:31.907014

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) met with industry players to discuss a token standard to support the compliant issuance and transfer of tokenized securities. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force met with Ethereum-aligned organizations on Thursday, including the ERC-3643 Association, Chainlink Labs, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Etherealize and Linux Foundation (LF) Decentralized Trust. During the meeting, the blockchain proponents and the SEC explored how open standards like ERC-3643 and compliance frameworks like Chainlink’s Automated Compliance Engine (ACE) could help bridge onchain technology with traditional regulatory requirements. ERC-3643 is a token standard aiming to become the foundation for compliant capital markets on the Ethereum network. It’s backed by the ERC-3643 Association and supported by companies like Chainlink. Chainlink ACE is a smart-contract-based framework for tokenized assets like securities or real-world assets (RWAs). Source: Redwan Meslem SEC shows openness to industry standards for blockchain compliance Dennis O’Connell, president of the ERC-3643 Association, told Cointelegraph that the SEC showed a noticeable shift in tone and approach during the meeting, compared with previous years. “The task force was very welcoming, engaged and motivated to bring the US into leadership,” O’Connell told Cointelegraph. O’Connell said that the SEC showed openness toward industry-led standards during the meeting. He told Cointelegraph that the task force had not previously considered the importance of open standards in blockchain. “We laid out our case on why, like other industries, including traditional finance, standards are fundamental to growing crypto in the US and enabling securities to come onchain,” O’Connell added. In the meeting, industry representatives presented proposals on all key elements of a regulatory framework for tokenized securities. This included identity, compliance, registry and control. O’Connell told Cointelegraph that the task force did not take a definitive stance on tokenized securities. He said they were “open to understanding how new technologies in blockchain meet concerns around identity, control and compliance.” O’Connell said the meeting resulted from months of behind-the-scenes work, ultimately resulting in a “major step for the industry.” He said the ERC-3643 Association and its partners plan to continue engaging with the SEC Crypto Task Force and other US government agencies, in hopes that the US will catch up with global regulation and eventually lead in blockchain adoption for capital markets.

The American Bankers Association and other bank and credit union trade groups said in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Thursday that its approval of national bank charters for the likes of stablecoin issuers Circle Internet Group and Ripple Labs “would raise significant policy and process concerns.” “There are significant policy and legal questions as to whether the Applicants’ proposed business plans involve the types of fiduciary activities performed by national trust banks,” the groups argued. Circle, Ripple and Fidelity Digital Assets are among a recent group of crypto-focused firms that have applied for banking licenses with the OCC, which would essentially allow them to be their own bank, settle payments faster and be regulated at a federal level, allowing them to operate in every state. Banks want a pause on greenlighting charters for crypto The groups have asked the OCC to postpone its decision on the crypto firms’ charter bids, claiming that the public portions of their applications “do not provide sufficient information for the public to assess or provide meaningful comment on the Applicants’ proposed business models and operations.” They added that the public should also be able to scrutinize the OCC if it allows the applications, adding it would be a departure from long-standing policy as the business models put forward by the crypto companies “do not involve the types of fiduciary activities historically performed by national trust charter banks.” “Providing custodial services for digital assets is not a fiduciary activity, and granting charters where traditional fiduciary activity is absent — or, is secondary at best — would represent a significant change in OCC policy that should be made only pursuant to a proper public notice and comment period,” the groups wrote. They said if the crypto firms are allowed to be national trust banks that provide “traditional banking services like payments,” then other companies could follow, which the groups said would present a “material risk to the US banking and financial system.” “Interesting reaction” by banking groups Caitlin Long, the founder of crypto-focused bank Custodia Bank, posted to X on Saturday that the group’s issue on whether trust charters can be used as “de facto bank charters” with just a fraction of the capital requirements is “very likely to be litigated.” “Interesting reaction by the bank trade associations to fight,” she added. “If what they fear will happen ends up happening, then why wouldn’t banks just convert to trust companies and keep their existing businesses at a small fraction of the capital requirements and regulations?” Source: Caitlin Long Venture firm Paradigm’s government affairs head, Alexander Grieve, said in response to the letter that “banks and credit unions rarely agree on anything. But they seem to agree that they’re finally about to have some competition from crypto.” Expect more crypto firms wanting bank charters Logan Payne, a crypto-focused lawyer at Winston & Strawn, recently told Cointelegraph that the newly passed stablecoin laws under the GENIUS Act create an incentive for stablecoin issuers to seek a banking license . Related: ‘Crypto Week’ ushers in big change: What happens now? A new stablecoin license under the laws would limit a crypto firm’s activity to only issuing stablecoin, but Payne said that “pretty much every stablecoin issuer in the United States issuing under US law right now engages in activities outside the scope of that license.” He said a stablecoin issuer would need state-level money transmission licenses to operate nationally, even with the new GENIUS Act license, creating an incentive for stablecoin issuers to apply for a national trust bank charter with the OCC. Payne said the charter “allows for them to engage in stablecoin issuance plus a wider range of activities, but without having to get state-to-state licenses.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight # Banking # Banks # Regulation Add reaction","Jesse Coghlan Jul 21, 2025 US bank lobby challenges crypto firms’ bids for bank licences US banking and credit union groups asked the OCC to delay deciding on bank license applications from crypto firms, arguing there are “significant policy and process concerns.” Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN Y",CoinTelegraph,2025-07-21 06:17:55+00:00,2025-12-07 14:13:02.184091,2025-12-07T19:20:31.907014

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The UK is reportedly eyeing the sale of over 5 billion British pounds ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to help fill a deficit in the country’s budget. The Home Office and the head of the country’s Treasury, Rachel Reeves, are working with law enforcement to sell off its stockpile of seized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and are developing a system to securely store the crypto ahead of the planned sell-off, The Telegraph reported on Saturday. Such a sale could potentially dent a recently renewed Bitcoin and crypto rally. Police handle crypto sales in the UK, but the Treasury is reportedly involved as the crypto market has rallied, boosting the value of the government’s holdings. The total amount of seized Bitcoin the country is holding is not known, but it contains at least 61,000 Bitcoin, currently worth around $7.1 billion, seized from a Chinese Ponzi scheme in 2018 that was being held in the UK. The idea of the UK selling its Bitcoin was floated earlier this year , with The Daily Mail and The Times reporting in January that Reeves could sell the Bitcoin stash to plug the country’s budget. Cointelegraph contacted HM Treasury for comment. Ponzi victims want UK to hand Bitcoin back However, the UK’s plans to sell the Bitcoin could be hung up by the victims of a Chinese Ponzi scheme, who have been seeking the return of the Bitcoin since 2024. “The UK's bitcoin is still legally contested,” Susie Violet Ward, the CEO of the crypto lobby group Bitcoin Policy UK, said in a post on X on Sunday, slamming the report as “sensationalism over substance.” “Chinese authorities and victims are demanding it back. No sale can happen while that legal process is unresolved,” she added. Source: Susie Violet Ward The UK seized the Bitcoin in 2018 after hospitality worker Jian Wen attempted to launder funds of an investment scheme conducted by Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology by trying to buy a mansion with BTC. Wen was later charged with three counts of money laundering, which she denied, but was found guilty in March last year and jailed for six years and eight months in May 2024. A group representing the Ponzi scheme’s victims asked China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry in April 2024 to negotiate with the UK to recover the Bitcoin. UK wants to keep seized Bitcoin Meanwhile, the Crown Prosecution Service has asked the High Court to let it keep the Bitcoin seized from the scheme, which could see the funds sold and split between law enforcement agencies. Freddie New, Bitcoin Policy UK’s head of policy, posted on X on Sunday that any sale of the crypto would happen under proceeds of crime laws, which set out that assets will be sold “to satisfy confiscation orders” and compensate victims if ordered by a court. “We understand that the victims here lost yuan, NOT Bitcoin. There’s an extra wrinkle here in that we also understand there may be diplomatic efforts underway to ask for the Bitcoin rather than the yuan which was originally lost,” he added. New said that after costs and victim paybacks, the remaining funds would go to the Treasury could be split between “those bodies involved in the asset recovery,” such as the police.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US fresh stablecoin legislation could create more demand for Ether ( ETH ) and decentralized finance applications, which are primarily based on the Ethereum network, according to analysts. The GENIUS bill , signed into law by US President Donald Trump on Friday, bans yield-bearing stablecoins , cutting off interest-earning opportunities for institutions and retail traders. This type of stablecoin generates interest or returns for the holder through yield-generating mechanisms, like staking or lending. According to crypto analyst Nic Puckrin, the removal of yield on stablecoins “is great news for Ethereum-based DeFi as the main alternative for passive income generation."" Yield can be used for passive income but also to mitigate the effects of fiat inflation. “The dollar is a depreciating asset without yield,” CoinFund President Christopher Perkins told Cointelegraph.“DeFi is where you can generate that yield to preserve value. And so I think stablecoin summer is going to turn into DeFi summer.” Ethereum accounts for the vast majority of total value locked in the decentralized finance sector. Source: DeFiLlama Interest-bearing opportunities are attractive to retail participants, but critical for financial institutions that are beholden to shareholders and must generate cash flow or realize gains on capital assets to satisfy their fiduciary obligations to investors. This necessity could have major implications for decentralized finance and could drive more institutional capital into the crypto space, as these financial institutions chase yield onchain.

Campbell added that lawmakers advocating against interest-bearing tokens were engaging in “cartel protection.” The increased competition from these yield-bearing fiat tokens will eventually displace traditional stablecoins altogether, according to Tether co-founder Reeve Collins. “If you are trusting that both the fiat-backed and the synthetic are stable, then you’re always going to be attracted to the one that gives you a higher yield,” Collins told Cointelegraph.

His role could expand significantly if current legislation shifting crypto oversight to the agency becomes law. The Senate Agriculture Committee will hold a meeting to consider Quintenz’s nomination before a potential floor vote on Monday. The meeting will follow a hearing held by the committee in June, marking the first step in his nomination since Trump announced it in February. The committee meeting will come as the Senate is expected to consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act following passage in the House of Representatives on Thursday.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Balkan country of Bulgaria seized over 213,500 Bitcoin back in 2017 and sold them the following year; now, that would be more than enough to cover the country’s public debt. When Bulgaria seized 213,519 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in late 2017, the haul was worth around $3.5 billion — enough to cover a fifth of the country’s national debt . The government sold the Bitcoin soon after the seizure — but some speculate that despite official denial the government may still hold the assets . Now, the same amount of Bitcoin would be worth about $25.24 billion. This exceeds the country’s public debt of $24 billion, according to World Economics data . This data might lead readers to believe Bulgaria played its cards incorrectly, but hindsight is 20/20. Founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich, told Cointelegraph that “Bitcoin's volatility makes it difficult to use it as a stable reserve.” Robert Znidar, director at crypto asset management platform Iconomi, was more critical of the decision. According to him, the sale was motivated by “unfamiliarity of the philosophy, utility and mission of BTC.” He added: “Considering the recognition that BTC and crypto have received in the last year, I am sure that this would not happen again.“ Bulgaria’s Bitcoin holdings chart. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries.NET Related: Bulgaria’s oldest football club adopts Bitcoin and Lightning, joins Nostr Long-term holding of Bitcoin is a reasonable strategy Obchakevich said the potential benefits of holding on to Bitcoin would be “overshadowed by the risks of a sharp drop in value.” Instead of holding it as a reserve, he suggests that the country should have diversified its holdings. “Limiting the share of Bitcoin to about 10-15%, phased liquidation, hedging through derivatives, and a clear legal framework to avoid macroeconomic instability are necessary,” he explained. Valentin Mihov, co-CEO at Web3 market maker Enflux and a Bulgarian, is not as convinced that his government made the right call. According to Mihov, the story “reflects how most governments still misunderstand what crypto can be: not just a speculative asset, but a strategic reserve opportunity.” He said that at the time, “most institutions still saw Bitcoin as radioactive, if they even knew about it,” so that played a significant role in the decision to sell, but was far from the only reason: “Custody was immature. Regulation was uncertain. The EU was tightening fiscal discipline, and there was less appetite for risk. From a conservative government’s point of view, liquidating the seized BTC was the cleanest path forward.“ Mihov said that if he had been advising the Bulgarian government at the time, he likely would have recommended a partial liquidation. However, he added, “I would’ve argued for a long-term reserve structure.” “Even a 10 or 20% strategic hold would’ve positioned Bulgaria ahead of the curve,” he highlighted.

After falling from $5.3 trillion in Q4 2024 to $4.6 trillion in Q1 2025, crypto spot trading volumes on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) plunged further to $3.6 trillion in Q2, the crypto analytics platform TokenInsight said in its latest exchange report released on Wednesday.

MEXC spot trades surge despite overall slump While the average daily spot trading volume dropped 23%, falling from $52 billion in Q1 to $40 billion in Q2, a few exchanges increased their spot trading volumes last quarter.

The only other exchange to see spot trading growth was Bitget, with spot volumes edging up around 0.7%. Spot versus derivative volume shares on major exchanges in Q2. Source: TokenInsight After two consecutive quarters of declining spot trading volumes, the market is expected to maintain this downward trajectory, according to TokenInsight. “Due to ongoing economic uncertainty, as well as limited liquidity and weak trading activity in the altcoin spot market, spot trading volume in Q3 2025 is projected to remain subdued, fluctuating between $3 trillion and $3.5 trillion,” the report noted. TokenInsight’s data aligned with a fresh crypto industry report by the crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, which suggested that spot trading volume on CEXs fell nearly 28% to $3.9 trillion in Q2. CoinGecko’s report also mentioned that MEXC, HTX, and Bitget were the only exchanges to see a surge in volumes since the previous quarter. In contrast, Crypto.com suffered the biggest drop quarter-over-quarter, with a volume drop of 61%. Crypto derivatives show resilience While spot markets on CEXs tumbled in the past quarter, crypto derivatives proved relatively resilient to price volatility. In Q2 2025, derivatives trading volume totaled $20.2 trillion — a 3.6% dip from $20.9 trillion in Q1.

Bitcoin ETFs shine as CEX volumes decline In contrast to CEXs’ dynamics in spot and derivative markets, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced remarkable growth in Q2, with major issuers like BlackRock posting a 370% surge in inflows compared to the previous quarter. BlackRock’s success came amid a broader surge in global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), which attracted $17.8 billion in inflows during the first half of 2025 .

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update: July 16, 5:28 am UTC: This article has been updated to add a post from Donald Trump. US President Donald Trump says he has convinced most of the Republican lawmakers who pulled support from three crypto bills to vote in favor of them when the House meets again on Wednesday. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday that he met with 11 of the 12 representatives in the Oval Office and convinced them to vote in favor of the legislation. “I am in the Oval Office with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass the GENIUS Act and, after a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,” Trump said. A re-vote on the three crypto bills was canned on Tuesday, as 13 Republican lawmakers pulled support, wanting to add a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Some Republicans wanted the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act amended or bundled in with two other crypto bills up for a vote this week — the CBDC-banning Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and a sweeping crypto market structure bill dubbed the CLARITY Act. The move to pass the bills is the Republican-led effort dubbed “Crypto Week” to have crypto laws in action before Congress goes on a month-long break in August. Democrats have meanwhile declared an “anti-crypto corruption week” to oppose the bills. “I’m thankful for President Trump getting involved tonight to ensure that we can pass the GENIUS Act tomorrow, and agreeing again to help us advance additional crypto legislation in the coming days,” House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on X. CBDC concerns stall legislation House Majority Leader Steve Scalise joined 12 other Republican lawmakers in voting no on considering the bills on Tuesday. The other dissenters were Andrew Clyde, Tim Burchett, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Michael Cloud, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Harris, Anna Paulina Luna, Scott Perry, Victoria Spartz, Chip Roy and Keith Self. Another vote to move the bills forward was expected, but the House adjourned before any further action was taken. Representatives Biggs, Burchett , Green, Luna and Spartz took to X after the vote and said they were not against the crypto bills but didn’t want to pass the GENIUS Act unless it had a specific ban on a CBDC . “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on central bank digital currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act,” Green said .

Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) July 15, 2025 Biggs said he was concerned the GENIUS Act had a framework for a layered CBDC and doesn’t guarantee self-custody . He is calling for amendments. “House Leadership must allow an open amendment process so Members can freely debate and improve the bill,” Biggs added. Trump included a ban on the Federal Reserve creating a CBDC in a January executive order. Number of bills was also a sticking point Politico reported that Johnson had earlier said he hopes to try to pass a procedural vote for the bills on Wednesday, adding it’s “a priority of the White House, the Senate and the House to do all of these crypto bills.” However, he added that “we have to do them in succession,” suggesting that the Senate wouldn’t pass the bills if they were all tied together. Johnson was also talking to the Republican holdouts to advance the legislation, which was complicated by the Republican “no” voters demanding that the three crypto bills be combined into one. “I think everybody is insistent that we’re going to do all three, but some of these guys insist that it needs to be all in one package.” House meets again Wednesday The House is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday for a morning hour debate and other “legislative business.” Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, said in an X post on Tuesday that the legislation failing to pass on the first go is nothing to be concerned about because the GENIUS Act failed to pass the Senate initially as well.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitlayer, a Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure startup backed by Franklin Templeton , has launched its smart contract bridge on mainnet, aiming to make Bitcoin more interoperable across multiple blockchain networks. The bridge, called BitVM, is described by the company as a “trust-minimized bridging solution for Bitcoin holders.” It enables users to deposit Bitcoin ( BTC ) into a smart contract, where it is held in escrow and converted into Peg-BTC (YBTC), a tokenized version of Bitcoin that can interact with smart contract platforms. According to Bitlayer, Peg-BTC is designed to facilitate programmability and crosschain compatibility. The company has already secured partnerships to integrate the bridge with networks including Sui, Base, and Arbitrum. A Bitlayer spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the new bridge is intended to “complement Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem by making native BTC liquidity accessible on networks that support smart contracts and more complex applications, without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s base layer.” Security has been a concern for crosschain bridges, which are often targeted by hackers due to exploitable vulnerabilities. In 2022, a hacker stole $321 million from a Wormhole bridge , though over $225 million was later recouped. According to Bitlayer, its bridge was built on previous models’ trust assumptions to beef up security. Whereas many bridges rely on a multisig trust model, BitVM uses a single signer.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Despite initial concerns about its effect on the European crypto industry, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is proving a benefit to crypto customers and exchanges alike. The EU’s first regulatory package concerning cryptocurrencies has been in effect for almost 200 days, and since then, a number of prominent exchanges have set up operations on the continent. In its first two quarters of operation, MiCA has shirked critics’ expectations that it would “destroy” the European crypto industry by overburdening exchanges with regulations and requiring users to identify themselves to stay on regulated platforms. Rather, the regulatory regime is set to consolidate the European crypto industry and serve as a catalyst for investor adoption. MiCA significantly increased reporting requirements for exchanges. Source: BVNK How crypto companies benefit from MiCA There are challenges to MiCA compliance for cryptocurrency firms. Firstly, MiCA is a relatively new law, and there is no guidebook for how to ensure compliance, which can lead to uncertainty during the application process, said Bybit EU managing director Mazurka Chen at a July 10 press conference. Secondly, there is the expense. It takes a significant amount of time, effort and money to ensure compliance, which is a cost more easily borne by large, established companies. Exchanges that are less able to bear that expense or view the MiCA ramp-up as “regulatory theater,” per Dante Disparte and Patrick Hansen — respectively the chief strategy officer and director of EU strategy and policy at Circle — may be forced to leave the market. This may be a windfall for responsible local actors, according to the Circle executives. “MiCA represents an opportunity [...] to grow a uniquely European crypto asset market.” Related: What is Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)? For stablecoin issuers, this means that non-EU-related products will vanish, leaving a gap and significant demand for MiCA-ready products to close the gap, stimulating, rather than dampening, the local stablecoin ecosystem. For exchanges, the bigger fish could gobble up the smaller ones, increasing market share. OKX Europe CEO Erald Ghoos previously told Cointelegraph that such a consolidation will separate “serious market players from unlicensed actors and [drive] healthy, trust-based competition.” Another MiCA benefit for crypto companies is the relatively equal legal footing they are on compared with traditional banks and asset trading services like eToro. According to Georg Harer, managing director and head of global compliance at Bybit EU, MiCA-regulated firms have the same Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards as major banks, so “there is no reason not to work with the MiCA license company anymore.” How MiCA benefits European crypto investors This more equal footing with traditional financial institutions also has knock-on effects for customers, such as easier bank transfers, broader institutional access and stronger protections for client assets. “With the license, we can onboard directly, and the client will be able to make deposits and withdrawals very easily from their own bank,” Bybit CEO Ben Zhou told Cointelegraph. “Then also, you have family offices, different types of trading institutions that can onboard on to us now because previously, maybe they were concerned about the licensing issues.” Licensing also lets exchanges expand their offerings. With MiCA and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), crypto exchanges can trade in traditional assets such as stocks and commodities, providing more familiar asset offerings for customers. Many of the provisions outlined in MiCA relate to investor protection and market integrity. Exchanges are subject to rigorous reporting and consumer protection requirements. Related: Malta’s MiCA licensing comes under scrutiny from EU regulator While this undoubtedly increases the regulatory burden on cryptocurrency exchanges, it also provides familiar guardrails for investors concerned about entering the cryptocurrency space. Harer said that the most important benefit for customers of MiCA-regulated entities is these protections. These include “the strict safeguarding of clients, assets and funds. You may remember FTX and others, where they reported that they had billions and billions in clients’ assets. And then, when somebody looked closely, it turned out that it was a lie or they were misused. This is now very, very strictly regulated.” More crypto exchanges are applying for a MiCA license Major American exchange Coinbase secured a MiCA license on June 20, with OKX and Bybit receiving theirs a week later . Zhou said the growing number of exchanges on the continent is “an extremely positive trend.” MiCA also has the potential to influence other regulators. Zhou said, “A lot of the regulators are waiting for MiCA. And you see the new framework being kind of borrowed or copied across the world.” As more exchanges enter the European market, competition is expected to intensify. Other regions are taking notice and moving to establish comparable crypto regulatory frameworks, as both customers and service providers gravitate toward jurisdictions with clear regulatory guardrails.

Those who use a so-called “unauthorized crypto-asset exchange service” could face up to two years in prison with penalties increasing based on the value traded , according to an update to the country’s Criminal Code that came into force on July 1. The updated laws also target unauthorized crypto service providers with up to three years in prison, which could increase depending on the value of illicit trades. Local news outlet Telex reported on July 1 that the laws have confused crypto companies serving the country, as Hungary’s Supervisory Authority for Regulatory Affairs (SZTFH) has 60 days to develop compliance frameworks for the laws, but no guidance exists in the meantime. New law for “abuse of crypto-assets” The first update to Hungary’s Criminal Code gives a penalty of up to two years in prison if an unauthorized crypto exchange is used to trade between 5 million to 50 million forints ($14,600 to $145,950).

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Three federal agencies of the United States government outlined the risks facing banks if they decide to custody crypto on behalf of their clients, according to a document published jointly by the agencies on Monday. While the announcement said that the document “does not create any new supervisory expectations,” it could provide a framework for banks that are considering entering the crypto space, as some reports have suggested they are. According to the document, titled “​​Crypto-Asset Safekeeping by Banking Organizations,” a bank’s risk assessment would include the ability to understand a complex and evolving asset class; the potential of liability if crypto assets were lost; and legal and compliance responsibilities associated with the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti Money Laundering regulations. Excerpt from “Crypto-Asset Safekeeping by Banking Organizations.” Source: FDIC “Providing crypto-asset safekeeping services may entail significant resources and attention,” it reads. The three federal agencies responsible for the document are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Often, financial institutions use third parties to custody their crypto assets. Asset manager BlackRock, for instance, has used Coinbase and later Anchorage for the custody of its Bitcoin ( BTC ). BNY Mellon, the US's oldest bank, also offers custody of digital assets for clients. The document notes that banks are responsible “for the activities performed by the sub-custodian.” This advice could be significant in the future if a bank’s custodian is hacked and the crypto is lost. The agencies write that audit programs are essential and should address the nuances of crypto assets, including key generation, controls related to the transfer and settlement of assets, and staff expertise. If the audit programs don’t exist within the bank itself, “management should engage appropriate external resources…to assess crypto-asset safekeeping operations.” Related: Trump administration mulls ‘debanking’ executive order: WSJ More favorable regulatory environment may appeal to banks There have been indications that some banks are considering an entry into crypto. In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of big banks was in “early talks” to issue a joint crypto stablecoin . The banks may see the current regulatory environment as more favorable, especially as governing bodies have made a move into crypto easier. For instance, the Federal Reserve has eliminated the “reputational risk” criteria from its oversight of banks, which critics say was used to unfairly target crypto businesses. Also in May, Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood wrote a letter to banks and federal savings associations saying they could buy and sell cryptocurrency that they are custodying at the direction of their clients. In 2025, the FDIC has undergone a “regulatory reset” and eased crypto restrictions for banks . Some native crypto companies are looking to go the opposite route: becoming a bank themselves. On July 2, Ripple, the creator of XRP ( XRP ), applied for a banking license with the OCC . Circle, the creator of stablecoin USD Coin ( USDC ), has done the same.

McGovern referred to the bills as the “GOP’s crypto giveaway,” criticizing the legislation for offering “weak and ineffective” regulatory solutions at the expense of investors. “I have not had one person in my district come up to me and say, ‘please, please Jim, make it easier for crypto millionaires to get richer, please make it easier to con people,’” said McGovern. “Yet that is exactly what is going on here.” “This isn’t about innovation — it’s about corruption [...] These bills even carve out special treatment for Trump’s personal crypto ventures.” Representative Jim McGovern addressed the House Committee on Rules on Monday. Source: YouTube North Carolina Representative Virginia Foxx, who chairs the committee, opened with a general overview of the three crypto bills and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. She began with claims on the GENIUS Act, suggesting that Republicans might be prioritizing the stablecoin bill over market structure and regulating CBDCs. “This legislation is historic, and it will help propel responsible innovation within America and lead us to securing an even stronger foothold within the global financial system,” said Foxx, referring to the GENIUS Act.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update July 16, 2025, 6:10 am UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from a Sonnet BioTherapeutics spokesperson. Nasdaq-listed biotech company Sonnet BioTherapeutics announced a strategic pivot into crypto, unveiling an $888 million entity to launch a Hyperliquid (HYPE) digital asset treasury. On Monday, Sonnet said it formed a business combination with the newly created Rorschach to launch a treasury strategy focused on the HYPE token, the native crypto token of the fast-growing Hyperliquid ecosystem. The deal includes transforming Sonnet into Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI), which is expected to be the largest United States-listed public company holding the HYPE token on its balance sheet. The company aimed to hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens, worth about $583 million when the agreement was made. In addition, it expects to have $305 million in cash, bringing its total value to $888 million. These funds will also be used to purchase more HYPE tokens in the future. Providing indirect exposure to HYPE via equity Hyperliquid is a high-throughput layer-1 blockchain that supports onchain trading of perpetual futures and other financial primitives. CoinGecko data shows that Hyperliquid has a market capitalization of $16.2 billion and is currently the 12th-largest token by valuation. With HSI’s creation, investors can gain indirect exposure to HYPE through equity markets, bridging traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Sonnet’s new project is backed by prominent companies, including Atlas Merchant Capital, Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, D1 Capital, Republic Digital and 683 Capital. The biotech company seems to be copying the playbook of the business intelligence firm-turned Bitcoin investor, Strategy, which provides indirect exposure to crypto through equity markets. In the press release, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang said Hyperliquid has “broken out” as a crypto project with strong fundamentals. He said they see institutional demand for HYPE exposure, while the token is difficult to access in the United States. Meanwhile, Sonnet will continue to operate as a subsidiary under HSI’s umbrella. It’s expected to retain its ongoing clinical oncology assets. Related: Hyperliquid news update: Growing user base could send HYPE back to $45 Why Hyperliquid was chosen as the treasury asset When asked why the HYPE token was chosen for the treasury over more established crypto like Bitcoin or Ether, a Sonnet BioTherapeutics spokesperson told Cointelegraph that it presents a different opportunity and is cheaper to trade. “They chose HYPE because it has created a completely different opportunity than the rest of crypto,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph. He added that it’s a non-custodial, decentralized layer-1 blockchain and digital asset exchange, and “it is significantly less expensive to trade versus the current large incumbent exchanges.” The spokesperson added that HSI wants to give US equity investors access to HYPE through a Nasdaq-listed company. Cointelegraph also asked the company why the final investment was $888 million, a number considered auspicious in Chinese culture. “It was a sign of good fortune that that’s the number we got to,” the spokesperson answered.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US House of Representatives is gearing up for what Republican leadership has branded “Crypto Week,” a legislative push scheduled from next Monday to Friday that could reshape the future of digital asset regulation in the country. This week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight explores the political stakes of these bills, the industry’s lobbying efforts and whether bipartisan support is enough to push legislation across the finish line. Lawmakers are expected to debate and potentially vote on three high-profile bills : the CLARITY Act, which would define regulatory oversight of crypto markets; the GENIUS Act, which creates a framework for stablecoins and has already cleared the Senate; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would ban the creation of a US central bank digital currency. Clarity for crypto Mason Lynaugh, community director at Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit advocacy organization backed by Coinbase, emphasized that the crypto industry sees this moment as urgent and potentially decisive. “We're seeing some unbelievable momentum, unbelievable attention and focus and bipartisan support for crypto as a topic.” “But the urgency is very real… while we have the momentum, we have to make sure we finish this mission,” said Lynaugh. Just days before Congress convenes, Stand With Crypto and more than 65 other companies and advocacy groups submitted a letter urging House lawmakers to support the CLARITY Act. Lynaugh acknowledged the rising political temperature around crypto. Related: Ripple CEO, ex-US regulators to address market structure at Senate hearing He added that the CLARITY Act tackles long-standing questions about regulatory jurisdiction and consumer protections. “This bill covers all of the questions about what does the SEC do?

What is decentralization?” Crypto and politics “It’s really unfortunate that people have tried to politicize crypto,” he said. “When you cut through the noise and you look at the numbers… this is a broadly bipartisan topic.” The group’s grassroots mobilization efforts have ramped up in recent months. “We have over 50 million Americans that own crypto,” Lynaugh said, pointing to 2.2 million Stand With Crypto advocates and over 70,000 emails sent to US senators ahead of recent votes. With the CLARITY Act and other bills facing a narrow pre-recess window, the forthcoming week may be the crypto industry’s clearest shot yet at shaping US law. Still, the stakes remain high.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 14, 10:00 am UTC): This article has been updated to add comments by Cypherium founder Sky Guo and Red Date Technology CEO He Yifan. Mainland China, one of the most restrictive global jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, is reportedly showing signs of a shift in tone regarding stablecoins amid new developments in Shanghai. The Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies, Reuters reported on Friday. Following the Thursday meeting, SASAC director He Qing called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies,” in a post on the authority’s official account. The initiative reportedly came in response to growing calls from experts and major companies in China to develop a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese yuan. China’s central bank weighing in on stablecoins China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has been addressing the issue of global stablecoin adoption, particularly in light of US policy to strengthen the power of the dollar through stablecoins like Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). In June, PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng reportedly acknowledged the transformative potential of emerging technologies like stablecoins in global payment systems, intensifying calls for regulatory approval of yuan-backed stablecoins. On June 23, China’s state media, Securities Times, published an article saying that the development of stablecoins “should be sooner rather than later.” Related: JD.com, Ant Group push yuan stablecoins to challenge US dollar dominance Subsequently, PBOC adviser Huang Yiping suggested exploring Hong Kong as a testing ground for yuan-backed stablecoins, stressing that mainland China’s tight capital controls make such experimentation unlikely. “Hong Kong has an offshore market for the renminbi, and if the offshore market develops, it is possible to create a stablecoin pegged to the offshore RMB in Hong Kong in the future,” Huang reportedly said. China “determined not to fall behind” in crypto race According to Cypherium founder and CEO Sky Guo, the news from Shanghai marks a significant shift in the Chinese government’s stance on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. “They now recognize that digital assets — including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization — represent the future of global payments,” Guo told Cointelegraph, adding: “Much like the AI race, China is determined not to fall behind in the emerging competition for dominance in crypto and stablecoin infrastructure and adoption.” However, not all local market observers share the same optimism. “The trend for Chinese government taking crypto serious started at the beginning of this year. Offshore-RMB-backed stablecoins will be issued in Hong Kong,” Red Date Technology CEO He Yifan told Cointelegraph. He expressed skepticism that China’s domestic crypto ban would be lifted anytime soon, adding: “The only regulated crypto trading in China that can happen is via the regulated HK crypto exchanges and the infrastructures like ‘Hong Kong Stock Connect.’” Is China among top BTC holders despite the ban? Shanghai’s recent stablecoin developments come despite mainland China’s ongoing crypto trading bans, reinforced by a major crackdown in September 2021 . While some in the community have speculated that mainland China might eventually lift its crypto ban, others argue that the government is unlikely to ease its stance and expose its 1.4 billion citizens to such a high-risk industry. In the meantime, multiple reports have suggested that China has been secretly stacking Bitcoin ( BTC ) to become the second-largest holder of the asset after the US. The Chinese government has never officially disclosed its Bitcoin holdings or any sale strategies. FTX payouts in China add fuel to speculation Beyond the rising calls for stablecoin adoption, speculation about China’s potential pivot toward crypto has intensified amid controversy over local payouts from the FTX bankruptcy estate. In early July, the FTX estate requested that a US bankruptcy judge authorize a freeze on distributions to creditors in “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions,” including China, which accounts for 82% of the value of the affected claims. The move has triggered outrage in the community in many countries, with some Chinese creditors highlighting that China has never banned holding crypto. On Tuesday, a Chinese creditor filed an objection to an FTX estate motion , representing a group of at least 300 creditors seeking to recover funds from the collapsed crypto exchange. According to court filings, a ruling on the motion is expected on July 22.

The EU regulator specifically highlighted the need to timely assess CASPs’ growth plans, scrutinize conflicts of interest in multi-service CASPs and evaluate risks from exposure to decentralized finance (DeFi) and unregulated services. “We trust that this review gives further confidence to those considering licensing in Malta and our peers with respect to our framework for cross-border supervision,” MFSA CEO Kenneth Farrugia noted in an official statement in response to the review.

ESMA highlights implications for NCAs Though focusing on Malta in its latest peer review, the ESMA emphasized that the review is targeting all NCAs across the EU. “ESMA sought to review MFSA’s approach in authorising and supervising the firm, but not to review the functioning of the specific firm,” a spokesperson for the ESMA told Cointelegraph, adding: “In the future, ESMA will continue using the peer review tool when it is appropriate, including in relation to other jurisdictions and topics.” The regulator also stressed that the peer review includes recommendations to consider in ongoing supervisory work, as well as in authorisation of future procedures. Malta’s crypto oversight no stranger to skepticism Although many perceived ESMA’s peer review into Malta’s crypto oversight as generally positive, the country’s approach to crypto supervision has faced its share of skepticism. Malta has long pursued its vision of becoming a “blockchain island,” requiring crypto platforms to obtain a financial services license in 2018. However, in 2020, 70% of the initial applicants failed to secure the license, with many speculating that the rules were too stringent. Source: Alpesh Doshi In 2021, a unit within Malta’s Chamber of Commerce dismissed allegations that the country had failed to maintain proper regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency businesses. In 2022, The Times of Malta also reported that the collapsed crypto exchange FTX had two Malta-registered firms, but the MFSA said neither was licensed to provide services. Some investigations pointed to Malta’s “fast-and-loose approach” to attracting crypto companies, highlighting that 85% of crypto businesses registered in Malta eventually left the island after the two-year transition period as of 2023.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Jonathan Gould, who previously worked as the chief legal officer of blockchain infrastructure company Bitfury, has been confirmed as the head of the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) following a Senate vote. In a 50-45 vote in the US Senate on Thursday, a majority of lawmakers voted to confirm Gould to head the banking regulator. In addition to his work at Bitfury, Gould is a partner at the Cleveland-based law firm Jones Day and served as the OCC’s senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel from 2018 to 2021. Gould’s nomination was the latest from US President Donald Trump to be addressed by the Senate since the president took office in January. The chamber has previously voted to confirm Trump’s pick to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins, and is expected to take up a vote for Brian Quintenz to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) soon. Expected to serve a five-year term at the OCC, Gould’s confirmation and others’ signaled a radical change in leadership of crucial US regulators, directed entirely by the Trump administration. Many in and out of government have suggested some of the president’s picks were catering to crypto industry interests following his 2024 election win, including his nomination of Atkins. Related: Trump’s CFTC chair pick won’t push president for bipartisan commission With the confirmation of Gould, acting OCC head Rodney E. Hood will likely step down. However, as of Thursday, Trump had not named any potential replacements for seats expected to open up at the CFTC in the coming months, with the exception of Quintenz. Brian Brooks, who also served as acting Comptroller of the Currency from 2020 to 2021, was briefly the CEO of Bitfury after his time in government. The former OCC head was the chief legal officer at Coinbase, the CEO of Binance.US, and has gone on to join the board of directors at Strategy. Senate push for crypto market structure is incoming Lawmakers in the Senate set a Sept. 30 goal to draft, introduce and vote on a bill to establish a market structure for digital assets, one of the key pieces of legislation for which many in the crypto industry have been advocating. Republicans in the House of Representatives announced plans to move forward with the chamber’s proposed market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, starting on Monday. The bill moved out of committee in June after lengthy debate, but could still take a backseat to the Senate’s efforts.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update, July 11, 9:10 am UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from Bit Mining chief economist Youwei Wang. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining is making a strategic shift into the Solana ecosystem, with plans to raise up to $300 million to support the move. The company said on Thursday it plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million in different phases to build a sizable Solana ( SOL ) token treasury. The capital will also be used to expand its capabilities within the network and acquire more tokens. As part of the plan, Bit Mining said it will convert some of its existing crypto holdings into SOL and adopt a long-term holding strategy. It did not specify how much of its reserves would be converted initially. BitcoinTreasuries.NET data shows that Bit Mining holds 19 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth about $2 million at current prices. While the company did not give specifics, Bit Mining chief economist Youwei Wang told Cointelegraph that it will convert “most” of its existing crypto holdings into SOL. “For future new crypto generated from mining activities, we will also gradually convert them to SOL after paying the electricity bills,” Wang told Cointelegraph. Bit Mining stock surges 350% on pre-market trading Bit Mining stock prices surged to a high of $11 in pre-market trading following the announcement, up 350% from its Wednesday closing of $2, according to Yahoo Finance. At the time of writing, the stock price has pulled back to $6.29. Bit Mining stock surges after Solana pivot.

Bit Mining said this allows it to further integrate within the Solana ecosystem and create sustainable value through blockchain participation. Bit Mining CEO Xianfeng Yang said the move shows their commitment and adaptiveness in an “ever-evolving industry.” The executive expressed confidence in their vision and ability to deliver value to their shareholders. “We are excited to take this bold step into what we believe is one of the most dynamic and promising ecosystems in the blockchain space,” Yang said.

The company said it will become a “pure play Ethereum staking and treasury company.” Unlike Bit Mining, Bit Digital stocks initially declined to $1.99 from $2.35 after the announcement, falling 15% on June 27 . However, the stock eventually recovered, surging to $3.59 on Wednesday, up 80% since the announcement, according to Google Finance data. When asked if more companies may follow this trend of building altcoin-based treasuries, Wang told Cointelegraph that more mid to small cap companies may want to diversify beyond Bitcoin. The executive said this may happen not because they don’t believe in Bitcoin, but because Bitcoin treasury requires more capital to be a competitive and legitimate player.

The trial is phase two of Project Acacia , a joint initiative from the RBA and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre announced in November last year.

Major banks onboard for crypto test Three of the four major Australian banks are part of the pilot: the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corporation. CBA said it will work with JPMorgan to evaluate how digital currencies and collateral records could deliver greater efficiency and liquidity with lower risk in the repo market. “The repo market, with its critical role in liquidity management and monetary policy implementation, represents an ideal starting point for this exploration,” Sophie Gilder, CBA’s managing director of blockchain and digital assets, said in a statement. The repo market involves short-term borrowing and lending of funds, secured by government securities, where one party sells a security to another party and agrees to repurchase it later for a higher price. ANZ is leading the testing of a use case for tokenized trade payables, which aims to address the challenges of working capital and cash flow faced by suppliers, the bank said in a statement. It will also conduct a tokenized fixed-income use case exploring a wholesale CBDC as a tokenized money to facilitate risk-free credit and liquidity settlement. Green light from regulators Australia’s markets regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has given participants a reprieve from some regulations so they can trial assets that currently sit outside the law, according to the RBA. ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke said in a statement that the agency “sees useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets.” “The relief from regulatory requirements that we have announced today will allow these technologies to be sensibly tested—to explore opportunities and identify and tackle risks.” The current state of crypto regulation in Australia Under its ruling center-left Labor Party, Australia’s government proposed a new crypto framework regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws back in March.

While Binance launched the BNB token and BNB Chain and offers perks for BNB holders on its platform, the exchange isn’t involved in developing the token or the blockchain. However, Zhao revealed in February that 98.5% of his crypto portfolio was BNB, without specifying the total value of his holdings. Forbes reported in June 2024 that Zhao and Binance together controlled around 71% of the BNB tokens in circulation at the time. The report said Zhao owns 94 million BNB tokens , currently worth nearly $63 billion and today would account for over 64% of BNB’s circulating supply, while Binance controls 46 million tokens. Zhao is banned from managing Binance as part of a deal with the US to plead guilty to money laundering violations, but he is still the exchange’s biggest shareholder. BNB is up 1.3% in the past 24 hours to trade above $670, according to CoinGecko. Crypto-buying firms a growing trend Many public companies have taken to stockpiling Bitcoin, but others have looked to buy and hold so-called altcoins such as BNB.

Zhao wrote to X on Wednesday that “there are over 30+ teams” that want to do a BNB treasury public company.

In a Wednesday statement, Peirce called on companies to discuss their potential tokenized offerings with SEC officials amid “new entrants and many traditional firms [...] embracing onchain products.” Though the SEC commissioner, who also heads the agency’s crypto task force, did not explicitly mention trading platform Robinhood, her notice came roughly two weeks after the company launched a tokenization-focused layer-2 blockchain. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” said Peirce. “Tokenized securities are still securities. Accordingly, market participants must consider—and adhere to—the federal securities laws when transacting in these instruments.” Peirce’s remarks echoed those of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who frequently called on companies considering offering crypto-related products that could be regarded as securities to “come in and talk” to officials. However, the US financial regulator has suggested that it was moving in a new direction for the crypto industry since the inauguration of US President Donald Trump and the confirmation of SEC Chair Paul Atkins.

The Massachusetts senator suggested that “non-crypto companies” could tokenize their assets to evade regulations enforced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “Under the House bill, a publicly traded company like Meta or Tesla could simply decide to put its stock on the blockchain and - poof! - it would escape all SEC regulation,” said Warren. “That is a serious problem for our country.” Senator Elizabeth Warren speaking at Wednesday’s hearing.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView “While the US debt reaches a new all-time high, the DXY has just hit a historically weak level, currently trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, marking the largest deviation in the past 21 years,” contributor Darkfost summarized in a Quicktake blog post. “Although this may appear alarming at first glance, it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin.” Bitcoin has regularly demonstrated inverse correlation to DXY over its lifespan, but in recent years, the relationship has become less clear-cut . Darkfost argued that the trend remains part of a broader risk-asset investment pattern. “As the dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, investors reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes,” he said. An accompanying chart showed the relationship between BTC price performance and the relationship of DXY to its 365-day MA. “This chart illustrates that phenomenon by highlighting periods where the DXY trades below its 365-day moving average,” Darkfost said. “Looking at historical data, it becomes clear that such periods have been highly favorable to BTC. We are currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could fuel a new rise in BTC but the price didn't react yet.” US Dollar Index (DXY) vs. BTC/USD (screenshot).

The groups argue that the DOJ is misusing Section 1960 of title 18 of the US Code, a statute originally intended to regulate unlicensed money transmitters, by extending it to developers of decentralized software. “The Government is actively prosecuting multiple developers of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency software [...] even if those developers simply publish open-source software,” the filing said.

Source: Paradigm Related: Judge signals Tornado Cash sanctions may be barred from Roman Storm trial DOJ slammed for targeting crypto coders The brief criticizes the DOJ's interpretation of “money transmitting” to include developers who write code for tools others use to transact independently. It compares the DOJ’s approach to prosecuting a frying pan manufacturer for what someone cooks in it. “By its plain meaning, § 1960 does not stretch that far... one cannot ‘transmit’ or ‘transfer’ funds on someone’s behalf without accepting and relinquishing custody or control,” the brief reads. The brief argues that the DOJ’s stance has sown legal uncertainty, discouraging developers from building privacy-enhancing tools or decentralized financial infrastructure. The lobby group warned that if the legal environment doesn’t change, innovation will migrate offshore. “Faced with possible prosecution [...] developers of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer software will choose to either move offshore or stop creating their tools altogether.” The filing comes as the DOJ continues to pursue cases like US v. Storm and US v. Rodriguez, where programmers behind tools such as Tornado Cash are facing criminal charges under the same statute. The brief urged the court to reject the motion to dismiss and allow the case to proceed, saying only a declaratory judgment can clarify the law and safeguard US neutral software development.

SharpLink’s chairman and Ethereum co-founder , Joseph Lubin, said the company was “continuously refining our treasury strategy.” Related: SharpLink buys $463M in ETH, becomes largest public ETH holder “Our sustained success is a direct result of SharpLink’s disciplined execution of its ETH-centric treasury management strategy and its unwavering commitment to operational transparency,” he added.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The judge overseeing the US criminal trial of Tornado Cash co-founder and developer Roman Storm said she was “inclined” to disallow any mention of the 2022 sanctions against the cryptocurrency mixing service in court. According to reporting from Inner City Press on Tuesday, Judge Katherine Failla of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York said she was unlikely to grant a motion prohibiting the mention of North Korea and the hackers in the Lazarus Group as part of prosecutors’ case against Storm. However, the judge reportedly said she was “inclined to keep out the August 2022 sanctions, since they were later withdrawn.” The sanctions in question referred to the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, adding addresses connected to Tornado Cash to its list of Specially Designated Nationals in 2022. However, after a federal judge ordered the repeal of sanctions as part of a civil case filed by Tornado Cash users, OFAC backtracked on the crypto mixer in March. “The sanctions were withdrawn,” said Failla, according to Inner City Press. “So [Storm] has consciousness of guilt for something he was not ultimately guilty of.” Storm was indicted in August 2023 for money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to violate US sanctions. Failla is expected to issue rulings on which witnesses will be allowed to testify before Monday, when the Tornado Cash co-founder’s trial is scheduled to begin.

The criminal case against Storm has prompted many high-profile figures in the crypto and blockchain industry to call for the charges to be dropped, echoing similar claims that “writing code is not a crime.” The Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Paradigm founder Matt Huang have contributed thousands of dollars to the Tornado Cash co-founder’s legal fund ahead of his trial. Assuming it moves ahead as scheduled, Storm’s criminal trial is likely to be one of the most significant legal events affecting the crypto industry following the conviction of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED As the United States Congress weighs key legislation that could reshape the regulatory framework for digital assets, top crypto executives, policy advocates and former regulators are set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee. On Wednesday, lawmakers with the US Senate Banking Committee will hear from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) member and Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, and others to address digital asset markets. The hearing will mark one of the first times US lawmakers could offer a preview of how the Senate will handle a crypto market structure bill after its leadership said it aimed to pass legislation by October. “We are at a critical inflection point,” said Mersinger in prepared testimony. “The choice before us is not whether to regulate this industry, but how. We can either continue down a path of uncertainty that cedes our leadership and exports this innovation to other countries, or we can enact sensible, bipartisan legislation that cements our position as the premier destination for financial innovation for decades to come.” Republican leadership in the House of Representatives announced on Thursday that they intended to tackle three pieces of crypto-related legislation starting on Monday as part of a regulatory “Crypto Week.” Among the bills are the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, passed by the Senate in June, and the Digital Asset Market Clarity, or CLARITY, Act, under consideration in the House. The chamber will also address legislation to halt the development of a US central bank digital currency, or CBDC.

Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, will also testify at the hearing, suggesting lawmakers could address concerns over Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in legislation related to digital assets. The US president issued his own memecoin in January, ahead of his inauguration. In addition, he and his family are tied to the crypto company World Liberty Financial, including its stablecoin, USD1. During the first Senate vote for the GENIUS Act in May, several Democrats withdrew support for the stablecoin bill , raising concerns about Trump’s crypto ventures. Though the bill later passed with Democratic support, some lawmakers have suggested they will continue to take action regarding concerns over Trump’s ties to the industry.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Coinbase's lobbying arm, along with a swathe of crypto firms, has urged US House lawmakers to quickly pass a major bill when they meet next week that would lay out how the crypto industry is regulated. In a letter sent on Monday, Stand With Crypto and 65 crypto advocacy groups and firms asked House lawmakers to back the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act — better known as the CLARITY Act. “We know that there have been efforts to politicize crypto legislation, but with crypto drastically reshaping the global economy the U.S. risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology,” it said. The CLARITY Act specifies the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission in policing crypto. It gives most of the jurisdiction over crypto to the CFTC, but the SEC would regulate products such as crypto-related securities. US crypto leadership “slipping,” groups say The group’s letter, signed by the likes of non-fungible token heavyweights OpenSea and Dapper Labs, claimed there were “already signs of U.S. crypto leadership slipping.” The groups said that a “lack of standardized rules hinders institutional adoption and innovation, pushing talent and businesses to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions abroad.” Source: Stand With Crypto “We cannot afford to let inaction and uncertainty jeopardize our ability to secure America’s economic future,” it added. “Above all else, the U.S. crypto industry needs market structure — which ensures there are clear rules of the road and provides the regulatory clarity that developers, users, and advocates need to continue innovating.” House to consider CLARITY Act during “Crypto Week” Republican House leaders said on Thursday that they would consider the CLARITY Act and two other crypto bills in the week starting July 14, in what they dubbed “Crypto Week.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber would also review the central bank digital currency-banning Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act. The GENIUS Act is likely to be at the top of the agenda, as it’s already passed the Senate, and US President Donald Trump said last month that he wants the bill passed as soon as possible before Congress goes on a month-long break in August. The CLARITY Act could be the next to hit Trump’s desk, as it’s now before the full House after the House Financial Services Committee and the Agriculture Committee advanced it on June 10 . It must still pass the Senate, and the Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said last month that he wants to pass a crypto market structure bill “before the end of September.” Democrats could disrupt CLARITY Act Senate Democrats had frustrated Republicans’ efforts to quickly pass the GENIUS Act to the House, citing concerns over Trump’s growing crypto ties, and House Democrats have already signaled similar concerns with the CLARITY Act. Maxine Waters, a top Democrat in the House Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing in early June that the CLARITY Act was a “rushed, overly complicated bill” that would exempt “some of the riskiest activities” in crypto. “Legitimizing Trump’s crypto con is far from the only terrible thing about this confusing and reckless legislation,” she added, pointing to the Trump family’s growing net worth from their crypto ventures. Trump has reportedly added at least $620 million to his net worth due to his and his family’s crypto ventures, which now include a crypto trading platform, a stablecoin, a crypto mining business, NFTs and multiple tokens.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has dismissed an appeal filed by crypto advocacy organization Coin Center against the US Treasury Department over its Office of Foreign Assets Control’s 2022 sanctions against the Tornado Cash mixing service. In a Thursday filing, the appellate court granted a motion to vacate a lower court ruling and remand with instructions to dismiss as part of a joint filing with Coin Center and the US Treasury. The dismissal, according to the court, would essentially conclude Coin Center’s legal challenge against the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Source: US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit In 2022, OFAC added multiple wallet addresses connected to Tornado Cash to its list of sanctioned entities. Coin Center filed a lawsuit alleging that the Treasury Department “exceeded [its] statutory authority” in the sanctions, though there were other lawsuits filed by interested parties, including one from six Tornado Cash users backed by crypto exchange Coinbase. The price of Tornado Cash’s native token (TORN) briefly surged by more than 14% to $10.55 on the news on Monday, before retracing to trade at $9.47 at the time of publication. “This is the official end to our court battle over the statutory authority behind the [Tornado Cash] sanctions,” said Coin Center executive director Peter Van Valkenburgh in a Monday X post. “The government was not interested in moving forward and defending their dangerously overbroad interpretation of sanctions laws.” Cointelegraph reached out to a Coin Center spokesperson but had not received a response at the time of publication. Related: US Treasury under Trump could take a different approach to Tornado Cash In January, the US District Court for the Western District of Texas ordered the repeal of OFAC sanctions against the mixing service as part of the case filed by the six Tornado Cash users. The Treasury Department dropped Tornado Cash from its lists of Specially Designated Nationals in March, arguing in court that the case was “moot” and did not require a final judgment. Tornado Cash developers are still in legal trouble The appellate court filing came roughly two weeks before Roman Storm, one of the co-founders and developers behind Tornado Cash, is scheduled to appear for a criminal trial in New York federal court. Storm faces charges of money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to violate US sanctions. It’s unclear whether the dropped appeal could be used in Storm’s case. Alexey Pertsev, another Tornado Cash co-founder and developer, has already been found guilty of money laundering in the Netherlands and sentenced to more than five years in prison. Roman Semenov, the other developer named in the same indictment as Storm, was still at large at the time of publication.

Source: Elon Musk Musk’s crypto ties Elon Musk is no stranger to Bitcoin as Tesla was an early adopter, holding BTC in its treasury. Under his leadership as Tesla CEO, Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, making it one of the first publicly traded companies to hold Bitcoin in its treasury reserves. Currently, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, worth approximately $1.26 billion, with the EV maker being the ninth-largest publicly traded company to hold Bitcoin in its treasury, according to Bitbo. The Tesla CEO has also supported Dogecoin over the years , which has caused the price of the memecoin to either rally or crash after his tweets. Jan3 founder Samson Mow said embracing Bitcoin could give Musk an edge over Trump in their ongoing feud. Mow stated that Tesla should once again start accepting Bitcoin as payment and that Musk’s SpaceX should give discounts to those who pay in Bitcoin. In 2024, Musk rejected the idea of using the Bitcoin network as a form of payment on Mars. However, Musk later entertained the idea , saying that a localized Lightning Network could solve the issue of slow transactions. Musk has not always been pro-Bitcoin. In 2021, he claimed that the price of Bitcoin was “too high,” which led to BTC dropping in price. Musk’s feud with Trump Musk’s relationship with Donald Trump has deteriorated over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” with Musk previously calling it “utterly insane and destructive” and arguing that it will erode millions of jobs in the US and cause “immense strategic harm” to the country. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade. Musk questioned Trump’s rationale for creating the DOGE, an initiative that aims at reducing the US national debt, if he was going to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars. He later hinted that the US needs a new political party that “actually cares about the people.” Related: Dogecoin price risks 66% drop to $0.06 as Trump-Musk feud intensifies On Sunday, Musk announced that he would be creating the America Party after more than 1.24 million people voted on his poll over whether he should create the party, with nearly two-thirds of voters voting in favor of the new party. “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk added. US President Donald Trump has since lashed out at Musk for creating a third political party. Trump said that Musk’s new party could fracture the Republican vote at the 2026 US midterm elections.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) could disappear within the next few years, according to Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan’s Kinexys. Speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025, Zaltsman said JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging onchain assets, signaling what could be a tipping point for mainstream blockchain adoption. “Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting,” said Zaltsman. She described JPMorgan’s blockchain strategy as “asset agnostic,” aiming to give clients real-time access to multiple networks while minimizing friction. The banking giant recently piloted synchronized settlement technology with Chainlink , allowing JPMorgan’s blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across different blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone a “very early sign” of how major banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets.

Source: Chainlink Related: TradFi will keep its distance until DeFi becomes a manageable risk DeFi and TradFi convergence closer than ever Zaltsman predicted that the artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance would dissolve faster than many expected, driven by improved infrastructure and growing industry willingness to work together. She noted that even a decade ago, JPMorgan had to build its own private blockchain due to the absence of suitable solutions. “Thankfully, that’s not the case today,” Zaltsman said. “It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support,” she added. “I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries,” Zaltsmann said. Last month, JPMorgan expanded its blockchain efforts by piloting its new deposit token , JPMD, on Coinbase’s Base network. Zaltsman called the launch “an exciting milestone for the team and I think kind of the Northstar moment for us.” Unlike stablecoins , these deposit tokens stay within the bank’s deposit system while offering clients direct access to blockchain-based markets, effectively bridging onchain liquidity with institutional cash management. Related: TradFi could move onchain due to ‘horrible banking experiences’ JPMorgan sets banking trend Meanwhile, Nazarov highlighted the industry-wide impact of JPMorgan’s participation. “What JPMorgan does is that it can drive a lot of the other banking institutions in the world to take notice,” he said. Nazarov also pointed out that cryptographic proofs and smart contracts can now give smaller counterparties the same reliability as top-tier banks, unlocking new opportunities in capital markets. “They can prove that solvency, you know, by cryptographic means. They can prove through smart contracts or oracle networks, through compliance engines verifying things,” he said, adding that this dynamic could boost competition and product innovation across financial services.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Robinhood’s plan to tokenize stocks on its new Ethereum-compatible blockchain could shift trading volume away from traditional exchanges like the NYSE, undermining their core revenues from trading fees and market data, according to Galaxy Digital. At the EthCC conference this week, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev detailed plans for “Robinhood Chain,” an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 on Arbitrum Orbit . The blockchain will let users trade tokenized derivatives of stocks directly on the blockchain, moving asset trading outside traditional exchange hours. Tenev explained that a new token engine operating on the Robinhood Chain would provide users with tokenized derivatives of their assets , enabling them to self-custody these tokens or interact with a decentralized application. By minting token “wrappers” linked to real stocks custodied by a US broker-dealer, Robinhood will offer users near-instant settlement and 24/5 trading at first, with 24/7 trading planned. The initiative leverages Robinhood’s recent acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp . Source: Galaxy Research Related: SEC ends ‘regulation through enforcement,’ calls tokenization ‘innovation’ Robinhood tokenization brings assets onchain In a Friday report, Galaxy Digital said Robinhood’s tokenization move removes assets from traditional market channels and brings them onchain, directly challenging the concentrated liquidity and activity that give major TradFi exchanges like the NYSE their edge. “This directly challenges the deep concentration of liquidity and activity that gives major TradFi exchanges (e.g., NYSE) their competitive advantage,” Galaxy Digital wrote. The platform’s architecture mirrors rollup models like Coinbase’s Base, giving Robinhood complete control of its sequencer and the ability to capture all transaction fees. Galaxy estimates Base generates over $150,000 in daily sequencer fees for Coinbase. By operating the sequencer for Robinhood Chain while controlling tokenized assets, Robinhood aims to monetize every layer of the trading stack — from “offchain trading to onchain utility,” the report said. Notably, the appeal of tokenized assets extends beyond 24/7 trading. Programmability could allow the use of tokenized stocks as collateral in DeFi protocols or the automation of dividends, features that traditional equities can’t match. As Galaxy noted, if incumbent exchanges can’t match the utility of tokenized assets, they risk becoming “custodians of a less functional version of the same assets,” pushing more traders to blockchain-based platforms. Related: ‘Everything is lining up’ — Tokenization is having its breakout moment Volatility risks remain However, the 24-hour trading model could introduce volatility risks for retail investors, who may wake up to sharp price moves outside regular hours. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge. While Robinhood’s tokens are only available to EU users, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not commented publicly on the model. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has already urged the SEC to reject trading of tokenized equities outside the Regulation NMS framework.

They are now planning to launch a new financial institution — named after a Lord of the Rings reference — to serve crypto companies and startups that have struggled to secure financing since SVB’s downfall. SVB’s dramatic collapse in 2023 triggered contagion across the US banking sector and led to tighter lending standards. While its assets were later acquired by First Citizens Bank, no institution has stepped in to fill SVB’s unique role — until now. For context: Before its collapse, SVB banked nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life sciences companies in the United States.

He’s an outspoken Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate and has also invested in Bullish, a crypto exchange that has reportedly filed for an initial public offering in the United States. The SVB collapse was the first domino in a US banking crisis that triggered several failures in 2023, including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.

Powered by Automatic Asset Extraction (AAE) technology, Circuit’s system helps institutions avoid catastrophic, permanent losses of digital assets. The solution has gone live with two institutional clients: UAE-based custodian Tungsten and Palisade, a crypto infrastructure company. “Institutions view asset recovery as a fundamental requirement, not a nice-to-have,” Donnelly said. “As more enterprises hold digital assets, ensuring those assets don’t simply disappear becomes critical. The institutional mindset is about risk management and fiduciary duty.” Circuit’s launch comes amid estimates that between 11% and 18% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply is already lost forever.

Listen 0:00 Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED On July 3, the US Congress passed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Donald Trump’s bill offers little to the crypto industry, but it could benefit Bitcoin all the same. Trump’s budget proposal passed in the late hours of July 3 entirely along partisan lines; only two Republicans voted against the controversial bill, which will significantly increase the US government’s borrowing ability. It has drawn significant criticism from Democrats and even from current and former Trump allies like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Notably absent from the bill were proposed amendments to the cryptocurrency tax code. As the bill worked through the Senate, lawmakers attempted to tack on a number of provisions regarding crypto, but to no avail. Despite the lack of specific crypto provisions, market observers are optimistic about the knock-on effects it will have for Bitcoin ( BTC ), but these are projected to come amid a wider economic upheaval. Source: Good Morning Crypto Big Beautiful Bill passed without any crypto amendments Leading up to July 3, observers in the crypto space were anticipating a reordering of the American tax code around cryptocurrencies. Crypto tax service Crypto Tax Made Easy noted clauses in the bill that would redefine rules around airdrops, smooth out reporting requirements for staking and create better de minimis exceptions, making it easier to spend crypto without triggering a taxable event. While the bill was still under debate in the Senate, Senator Cynthia Lummis also suggested an amendment that would remove the “double tax” on Bitcoin miners. Per Lummis, miners are currently taxed twice, first when they receive the block reward and then again when they sell the Bitcoin. Related: US Senate passes Trump’s budget bill without provision on crypto taxes Still, the bill draft that passed the Senate and moved onto the House of Representatives did not contain any clauses about crypto. According to Decrypt , the efforts to include crypto provisions were a “Hail Mary” in a political process already rife with in-fighting and last-minute bargaining. Bill can still benefit Bitcoin, but broader economic outlook isn’t good Despite the lack of attention to digital assets, market observers are optimistic that Bitcoin could see a significant price spike as the bills hike the national debt ceiling — the amount of money the government is allowed to borrow — by $5 trillion, a historic amount. Jessica Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told The Washington Post, “President Trump has added more red ink than any president since at least LBJ [Lyndon B. Johnson], and he is doing it on top of deficits that had already been soaring.” Crypto analyst Ranjay Singh said that, while there may be hills and valleys in the short term, “More debt can lead to more money printing. That’s good for BTC in the long run.” Nigel Green, CEO of advisory firm deVere Group, told Cointelegraph, “Markets have already begun to respond. Long-term yields are creeping up. Oil has moved higher. Gold and Bitcoin are rising on renewed fears about the erosion of purchasing power.” Still, while Bitcoin hodlers rejoice as investors flee to inflation-resistant assets, the bill and the Bitcoin gains may come at a greater cost to the world economy. The bill will introduce a number of tax cuts for the US’s wealthiest. Earners over $1 million are expected to see an after-tax income boost of over 3%, while increasing state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000 for those earning less than $500,000 annually. Estate tax exemptions were also increased to $15 million. The bill aims to offset these significant tax reductions and increased government spending with cuts to critical benefits programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, as well as income from tariffs. According to Reuters, some 10 countries are expecting letters from the Trump administration announcing 20%-30% hikes in tariffs on July 4. Green said, “This bill throws open the taps on spending while throttling the flow of global goods. It’s a high-stakes gamble with inflation — and one that the rest of the world will end up paying for.” This increase in government spending, along with tariffs on global trade, represents a “permanent reordering of the trade and spending model,” he stated. Trump is set to sign the bill into law on July 4, the US’s Independence Day. Crypto week incoming in Washington While the world economy and Medicaid recipients are bracing for the impact of the Big Beautiful Bill, pro-crypto lawmakers in Washington are already busy. On July 3, Lummis introduced a solo bill to address her aforementioned qualms with the tax code for miners. The bill also contains a de minimis exemption for digital asset transactions and capital gains of $300 or less, with an annual cap of $5,000.

Double taxation, unclear policies frustrate US crypto investors Digital asset taxation has become a hot-button issue in the crypto industry, with executives, investors, traders, and users frustrated by the lack of clarity and tax efficiency in the United States. One major topic of contention is the tax treatment of completely decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-custodial platforms where the developers do not have control over funds or consensus rules. In June, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee introduced an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, the crypto market structure bill, exempting developers of decentralized protocols from being classified as money-transmitting services. This would also exempt these DeFi protocols from the same tax reporting requirements as centralized exchanges and other crypto businesses employing a traditional business structure. US lawmakers are scrambling to include crypto provisions in the final version of the spending bill before it hits US President Donald Trump’s desk.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED A US government watchdog has recommended reforms to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigation division’s handling of digital assets, citing repeated failures to follow established protocols. In a Tuesday report, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said its evaluation of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) revealed shortcomings around the seizure and safeguarding of digital assets. According to the government watchdog, the IRS failed to follow all guidelines between December 2023 and January 2025 for seizure memorandums around confiscated crypto, detailing the addresses, dates, and amounts. “The recommendations that IRS-CI agreed with include: ensuring that IRS-CI personnel are familiar with and adhere to seizure memorandum requirements; establishing an inventory system that can manage seized digital assets to include accurately tracking the quantity of digital assets and ensure the consistent treatment of all seized digital assets; and updating internal guidelines to include time frame requirements for preparing the seizure memorandum and updating records in its inventory tracking system,” said the report. The seizure and holding of digital assets by US government authorities has become more relevant since efforts by the Trump administration to establish national Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto reserves.

The United States’ first Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) ended its debut trading day with $12 million in inflows — a positive sign for crypto staking-enabled ETFs. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF debuted on the Cboe BZX Exchange on Wednesday, recording $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in inflows, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The fund , trading under SSK, gives investors direct exposure to spot Solana ( SOL ) along with staking yields, making it the first crypto staking ETF to be approved in America. It was a “healthy start to trading,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who observed that it had seen $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes. Balchunas also commented on the impressive first-day volumes, stating that it “blows away” the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs but was much lower than the spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) funds when they launched. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $4.6 billion worth of shares traded on their first day in January 2024. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs is a defining moment for digital assets and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” said Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, whose firm is the staking and custodian partner for the REX-Osprey ETF. “I don't think this really tells us all that much,” Seyffart told Cointelegraph. “What we can see is that there will definitely be demand for these products. We are also in a shortened week in the US for the 4th of July, so demand and trading might even be more muted than it otherwise would be.” SSK first day volume. Source: Eric Balchunas Fund faced regulatory hurdles The REX-Osprey fund faced regulatory hurdles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which objected to it in late May after clearing an initial registration. The issue was whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under securities laws, but the firm managed to get around this by investing at least 40% of its assets in other ETPs, mostly domiciled outside the US. More eyes on spot Solana ETF, altcoin ETF summer Unlike spot Solana ETFs that still require approval from the SEC, REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act 1940, which sidesteps the standard 19b-4 filing process. In May, NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci described it as  “regulatory end-around.” However, some have debated whether the fund should be considered a traditional spot Solana ETF. Meanwhile, the ETF’s recent performance could shed light on institutional demand for a spot Solana ETF, which may launch this year. Seyffart and Balchunas recently pegged a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs would be approved by the end of the year. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in the second half of 2025,” Seyffart said earlier this week, predicting that spot XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ( LTC ) products would be greenlit by the SEC before the end of the year.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto firm Ripple Labs is applying for a banking license in the US, following a similar move by stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group as crypto firms look to be regulated to deepen ties with traditional finance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed on X on Wednesday that the company is applying for a license with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), following an earlier report by The Wall Street Journal. “True to our long-standing compliance roots, Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC,” he wrote. Garlinghouse said if the license is approved, it would be a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market” as the firm would be under federal and state oversight — with the New York Department of Financial Services already regulating its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. Source: Brad Garlinghouse Ripple follows Circle on wanting bank charter Ripple’s decision to get a banking license came just two days after Circle, which issues the second-largest stablecoin USDC ( USDC ), applied to the OCC to create a national trust bank that would oversee its stablecoin reserves. The move by both firms comes as the US Senate passed a stablecoin regulating bill called the GENIUS Act , which lays out standards for offering the US dollar-pegged tokens, including that the OCC will oversee larger stablecoin issuers. Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said the company was taking “proactive steps” to “align with emerging US regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins.” Anchorage Digital is the only crypto firm that holds a national bank charter. Ripple bids for Fed master account Ripple’s Garlinghouse added that the company also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve, which would give it access to the US central banking system. “This access would allow us to hold $RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed and provide an additional layer of security to future proof trust in RLUSD,” Garlinghouse said.

Ripple applied for the account through Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm it acquired in February 2024. XRP gains over 3% on Ripple’s bank charter application XRP ( XRP ), the token of the XRP Ledger blockchain that Ripple Labs uses for its products, has risen 3.2% over the past day to trade at $2.24, according to CoinGecko.

He has been widely recognized for his openness toward cryptocurrency and digital finance, as well as his emphasis on developing a robust regulatory framework for the sector. Atkins, like others, has recognized the importance of supporting the growing tokenization economy. Tokenization has emerged as a key driver of crypto adoption, thanks in large part to a more pro-crypto regulatory environment in the United States, according to a recent Binance Research report shared with Cointelegraph. The World Economic Forum also views tokenization as a promising bridge between traditional financial systems and blockchain, with the potential to reshape global finance.

In April, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance on company disclosures related to digital assets, aiming to clarify which tokens fall under securities laws. The regulator also recently approved the first US crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Solana ( SOL ), allowing investors to hold the cryptocurrency and earn yield through staking.

Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 5, 8 am UTC): This article has been updated to insert comments from the ECB and Nicholas Anthony. The European Central Bank (ECB) has approved a two-track plan to settle distributed ledger technology (DLT) transactions using central bank money, which could pave the way to modernizing Europe’s financial system. The first track, dubbed Pontes, will focus on a short-term solution by linking blockchain-based DLT platforms with TARGET Services, a suite of financial services developed and operated by the Eurosystem designed to facilitate the flow of payments and securities within the eurozone. A pilot for Pontes is expected to launch by the end of the third quarter of 2026, the ECB said Tuesday. This pilot will use insights from the ECB’s exploratory DLT trials in 2024, which involved over 50 experiments and 64 participants, to test a unified settlement system with central bank money. “The decision is in line with the Eurosystem’s commitment to supporting innovation without compromising on safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures,” the ECB wrote. Related: Europe gears up to regulate DeFi in 2026 as MiCA leaves sector in limbo Second track takes long-term approach The second track, called Appia, takes a longer-term approach, aiming to develop an “integrated ecosystem in Europe that also facilitates safe and efficient operations at the global level.” Appia will see the ECB continue to study DLT applications in wholesale central bank settlements while working closely with public and private partners. The Eurosystem will also set up market contact groups for both Pontes and Appia to maintain dialogue with industry stakeholders and gather feedback. A call for expressions of interest to join the Pontes group will be published soon. “It’s difficult to say whether this will prove to be an important step until the testing results are published. In the past, most central banks testing the use of distributed ledger technology have said it ultimately didn’t fit their goals,” Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said. The plan comes as central banks worldwide explore how blockchain can streamline settlements while maintaining control over money flows. In 2023, a Bank of England experiment, conducted through the BIS London innovation hub, successfully tested using DLT to run large-scale interbank transactions . It demonstrated a prototype that could speed up and lower the costs of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems by linking them with other financial infrastructures and ledgers. “With its dual-track strategy, the Eurosystem ensures that central bank money, the safest of all settlement assts, can continue to be used as settlement asset on the wholesale market and as anchor for the two-tier monetary system,” the ECB told Cointelegrpah, adding: “Furthermore, the initiative aims to promote strong, stable and integrated European payments and capital markets, will safeguard the strategic autonomy, as well as maintain and develop the international role of the euro.” Related: ECB flags risk of financial contagion from US crypto push DLT trials reveal demand for central bank money The ECB also published a report detailing the results of its recent DLT exploratory work.
